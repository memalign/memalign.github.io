In an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38732804">HN post</a> about a very cool <a href="/p/puzzlescript.html">PuzzleScript</a> game called <a href="https://jacklance.github.io/PuzzleScript/play.html?p=cfdcc6e23f1fb3e9de2fd42fafaf4d4c">Enigmash</a>, I learned sad news.<br />
<br />
Jack Lance, the author of the game, died earlier this year.<br />
<br />
I went to his website, <a href="https://jacklance.github.io">jacklance.github.io</a>, and saw that it had been updated to refer to him in the past tense.<br />
<br />
Seeing that the site is hosted on GitHub, I looked at the <a href="https://github.com/JackLance/jacklance.github.io/commit/92fc694347c53c7c87d8d5086aefde10a9a422de">recent updates</a>. I discovered two things:<br />
<br />
- He made this update himself, to show up a few days later<br />
<br />
- He published one last game, Octogram, but unfortunately made a typo in the URL to the game<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Update 12/30/23: I <a href="https://github.com/JackLance/jacklance.github.io/commit/92fc694347c53c7c87d8d5086aefde10a9a422de#commitcomment-135624323">commented</a> on the git commit and one of Jack's siblings saw it. They pushed a fix and now the link on Jack's website is working!<br />
<br />
Here's a working link to Jack Lance's last game: <a href="https://jacklance.github.io/octogram.html">Octogram</a>.<br />
<br />
It's a super tricky puzzle game with fun wordplay. Give the <a href="https://github.com/JackLance/jacklance.github.io/blob/master/octogram.html">source code</a> a peek if you get stuck -- but beware this will spoil all of the answers!<br />

I've grabbed a separate <a href="https://github.com/memalign/memalign.github.io/tree/master/m/octogram">backup</a> of every gist linked to by his games page for posterity.<br />
- A YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_xdEIPZ2Po">video</a> where Jonathan Blow mentions Jack's death. "...he was 25... he was already one of the best game designers in the world and was on track to be even better"<br />

Tags: <a href='/tags.html'>Programming</a></div>
In the same vein as <a href="/p/freshrss.html">FreshRSS</a>, another open source project with a cool API is Mastodon.<br />
<br />
Many users I followed on Twitter (now X) have migrated to Mastodon. I found that the Mastodon apps I tried didn't perfect the one thing I want: to read a chronological timeline of posts and reblogs from the accounts I follow - always keeping my spot since the last time I checked.<br />
<br />
I had already written my own Twitter client for this, which I've been using for many years, and just finished adapting that for Mastodon.<br />
<br />
The Mastodon API made this really easy! I can tell that a lot of care went into making this core use case straightforward. Thank you Mastodon developers!<br />
<br />
Here's the short list of requests needed to make a simple Mastodon timeline viewer app:<br />
<br />
<div id='code'>Below, I&#039;m using https://mstdn.party but you should substitute the Mastodon server you use.<br />
<br />
1. Register your app.<br />
- Docs: <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/apps/#create">https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/apps/#create</a><br />
- Replace YOURAPPNAME and YOURWEBSITE below. YOURWEBSITE should be a full url starting with &quot;https://&quot;<br />
<br />
curl -X POST -F &#039;client_name=YOURAPPNAME&#039; -F &#039;redirect_uris=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&#039; -F &#039;website=YOURWEBSITE&#039; https://mstdn.party/api/v1/apps<br />
<br />
The response is JSON and includes important fields you will need in later steps: client_id and client_secret. I&#039;ll refer to these as YOURCLIENTID and YOURCLIENTSECRET below.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Give your app permission to read your account information. Open this URL in your browser and authorize it. You&#039;ll be shown an authorization code which I&#039;ll refer to as YOURAUTHCODE below.<br />
- Docs: <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/oauth/#authorize">https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/oauth/#authorize</a><br />
<br />
https://mstdn.party/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=YOURCLIENTID&amp;redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Get an access token for your app to use to request your account&#039;s timeline (and make any other helpful API requests).<br />
- Docs: <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/oauth/#token">https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/oauth/#token</a><br />
<br />
curl -X POST \<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-F &#039;client_id=YOURCLIENTID&#039; \<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-F &#039;client_secret=YOURCLIENTSECRET&#039; \<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-F &#039;redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&#039; \<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-F &#039;grant_type=authorization_code&#039; \<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-F &#039;code=YOURAUTHCODE&#039; \<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-F &#039;scope=read&#039; \<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://mstdn.party/oauth/token<br />
<br />
The response is JSON and includes the access_token. I&#039;ll refer to that as YOURACCESSTOKEN below.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Now your app can load your timeline.<br />
- Docs: <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/timelines/#home">https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/timelines/#home</a><br />
<br />
curl &#039;https://mstdn.party/api/v1/timelines/home&#039; -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOURACCESSTOKEN&#039;<br />
<br />
The result is JSON with everything you need to display the timeline in full. I love that it&#039;s all included in a single API request! This even includes account information (display name, username, the image URL for the poster&#039;s avatar, and more) for the people you follow and the people whose posts they have reblogged.<br />
<br />
One helpful argument to include is &quot;limit&quot;. I like to request the max number of posts supported by the API, 40.<br />
<br />
curl &#039;https://mstdn.party/api/v1/timelines/home?limit=40&#039; -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOURACCESSTOKEN&#039;<br />
<br />
When refreshing my app, I want to request all posts that are new since the last time I refreshed. I accomplish this by using the max_id argument.<br />
<br />
I start by requesting the most recent 40 posts:<br />
<br />
curl &#039;https://mstdn.party/api/v1/timelines/home?limit=40&#039; -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOURACCESSTOKEN&#039;<br />
<br />
I check if this includes the last post my app is aware of. If not, I request farther back by including &quot;max_id=&quot; the id of the oldest post in the response I just got. Example:<br />
<br />
curl &#039;https://mstdn.party/api/v1/timelines/home?limit=40&amp;max_id=123456789&#039; -H &#039;Authorization: Bearer YOURACCESSTOKEN&#039;<br />
<br />
I continue loading back like this until any of these conditions are true:<br />
- I find posts that my app already knows about<br />
- I get no posts in response<br />
- I get posts older than 1 month (I don&#039;t want to accidentally load back too far)<br />
- I&#039;ve made more than 5 requests (I don&#039;t want to create excess traffic)</div>
And that's it! My app only needs to use a single API to refresh my timeline. I did steps 1 through 3 manually and hard-coded the access token into my app, using it to perform step 4 every time I want to refresh. This is ok because this app is just for me so I don't need a more dynamic authentication flow.<br />

There's not enough time in the day for everything I want and need to do. Parenting, work, exercise, hobbies, sleep, etc.<br />
<br />
I've found that even optimizing a few minutes here and there can add up to make life easier and more enjoyable. I still use tools for consuming <a href="/p/tts-download-into-brain.html">text</a> and <a href="/p/speed-up-av.html">audio/video</a> faster.<br />
<br />
Here's one of the biggest new optimizations I was able to make this year.<br />
<br />
I had a bunch of work time and a bunch of hobby time I wanted to spend in front of a keyboard. This is thoughtful writing or programming time that couldn't be stolen a few minutes at a time while waiting in line, walking between meetings, etc.<br />
<br />
I also had a bunch of underutilized time on a stationary exercise bike. I mostly spent that time reading news feeds or watching TV/movies. I enjoyed that a lot, but it wasn't the right balance of time spent doing that when I had other things I wanted to prioritize.<br />
<br />
I searched for a product that would let me use a laptop or iPad + keyboard case while exercising on the stationary bike.<br />
<br />
I came across <a href="https://airdesks.com">airdesks.com</a> and bought their <a href="https://airdesks.com/products/laptop/laptop-desk/">laptop desk</a>. I got the 64" tall, "Average Size Laptop", No AirShelves config. It's been awesome. I use it on the bike every day and occasionally as a standing desk.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm writing this post while exercising on the bike while my son is napping -- something I couldn't have squeezed in without this desk!<br />

This year has been rocky for free APIs I've enjoyed adopting in personal projects. Twitter (now X) killed 3rd party clients, Reddit made similarly killer API pricing changes, and now Feedly has started charging too.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Feedly's API pricing is very reasonable right now: $8/mo or $72/year!<br />
<br />
Feedly provides a great service, as I <a href="/p/feedly.html">wrote</a> in March 2020. It's worth paying for at this price.<br />
<br />
I've depended on Feedly ever since Google Reader shut down in 2013. I seamlessly migrated and never had problems for 10 years of use. Feedly is a great way to keep up to date with RSS feeds and there are several great RSS reader apps that support it. Feedly is very reliable and "just works".<br />
<br />
But this is an era of paid subscription overload. Even though the price is reasonable, I sought out alternatives that wouldn't carry the risk of incremental price increases over the coming years.<br />
<br />
And I found one that, for the past few weeks, has proven to be good enough to replace Feedly for me: <a href="https://www.freshrss.org">FreshRSS</a> (<a href="https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS">GitHub</a>).<br />
<br />
It's a free and open source project but using it came with the cost of time. I spent the past few weeks writing a bunch of code, finding a reliable host, and cross-checking with Feedly to ensure I'm getting good results.<br />
<br />
Here are some notes on adopting FreshRSS in a personal project. The complexity and uncertainty are the downsides of using this instead of Feedly. The benefits include its price (free), that it is open source, and the option to self-host.<br />
<br />
- Export existing feeds from Feedly as an OPML file. <a href="https://docs.feedly.com/article/52-how-can-i-export-my-sources-and-feeds-through-opml">Instructions</a>.<br />
<br />
- Find a FreshRSS host or host it yourself. Here's a list of <a href="https://freshrss.org/cloud-providers.html">official hosts</a>. I tried one, but found it to be unreliable -- it seemed to purge my history after ~1 week. I switched to a different one and have had better results.<br />
<br />
- Once logged into the FreshRSS host, update some settings:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Profile: create an Authentication token. This will be used to automate updating all feeds. Create an API password. This will be used when you adopt the API to load feed information, news entries, and mark them as read. Take note of the API URL (example: https://host.tld/p/api/).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Archiving: change settings to keep longer history. I think this helps avoid old articles reappearing as unread in your feeds. These settings do not appear to be honored by all hosts.<br />
<br />
- Import OPML file into FreshRSS: In the web UI, click the folder icon, then Subscription Management, then the folder icon (again), then Import / Export. Then you can pick a file to upload to import.<br />
<br />
- To reliably refresh all feeds from the source, I've found it necessary to set up a cron job on a server I own to force FreshRSS to refresh. I'm running this every 4 minutes, but FreshRSS will only honor it every ~15-20 minutes. Use your username and the authentication token configured in FreshRSS settings. Make sure to URL encode them (space will need to be replaced by +, special characters will need to be %-encoded).<br />
<div id='code'>*/4 * * * * /usr/bin/sh /path/to/updateFreshRSS.sh</div>
updateFreshRSS.sh:<br />
<div id='code'>/usr/bin/curl &#039;https://host.tld/p/i/?c=feed&amp;a=actualize&amp;ajax=1&amp;force=1&amp;user=YOURUSERNAME&amp;token=AUTHENTICATIONTOKENSETABOVE&#039;</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Most RSS feeds keep enough history that you won't miss entries even if you refresh infrequently. For me, one feed in particular lost entries in FreshRSS compared to Feedly: the unofficial Hacker News front page feed from <a href="https://hnrss.github.io/">hnrss.org</a>. Because this feed seems to provide a current snapshot rather than full history, FreshRSS's less frequent refreshes ended up missing entries that Feedly would catch. My frequent cron job plus changing the feed url from https://hnrss.org/frontpage to https://hnrss.org/frontpage?count=100 worked well enough to nearly match Feedly's results (and any discrepancies were actually desirable, like missing posts that were quickly flagged to death).<br />
<br />
- Now, you're ready to adopt the API. FreshRSS's API is identical to Google Reader's! The official documentation even links to old web pages that detail the Google Reader API. I found a few docs helpful:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- The <a href="http://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/developers/06_GoogleReader_API.html">official documentation</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- The server-side <a href="https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/blob/edge/p/api/greader.php">code</a> that implements the API<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130710044440/http://undoc.in/api.html">old archived webpage</a> that details the Google Reader API<br />
<br />
Some important requests:<br />
<br />
<div id='code'>Authenticate:<br />
curl &#039;https://host.tld/p/api/greader.php/accounts/ClientLogin?Email=YOURUSERNAME&amp;Passwd=YOURAPIPASSWORD&#039;<br />
<br />
This gives a response that looks like:<br />

LSID=null<br />
Auth=YOURUSERNAME/123456123456123456abcdefabcdef1234561234<br />
<br />

Introducing my latest project: <a href="/m/fireworks/index.html">Fireworks Tap Toy</a><br />
<br />
On this year's Fourth of July, my toddler son discovered a love of fireworks. With Fireworks Tap Toy, I'm trying to bring some of that magic to the touch screen.<br />
<br />
Tap, click, type, or go into "auto launch" mode.<br />
<br />
This project is a remix of a few other projects:<br />
<br />
- <a href="/m/taptoy/index.html">Tap Toy</a>, which has its own <a href="/p/taptoy.html">story</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I copied and modified index.html and progressive web app pieces<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I copied over touch, mouse, and keyboard support<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I copied over sound effects and music utilities<br />
<br />
- An old <a href="https://codepen.io/whqet/pen/abooRX">codepen</a> (<a href="/m/fireworks/codepen.html">backup</a>) someone created to teach others how to animate fireworks using JavaScript canvas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I chose this over fireworks JavaScript frameworks people have shared because it's so much simpler. I don't like the hassle of dependencies. I don't want to install some tool or import an opaque blob. I just want to write some (ideally self-contained, vanilla) code for fun. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/crashmax-dev/fireworks-js/">top hit</a> for 'fireworks javascript' which I looked into and chose not to use. Where even is the code??<br />
<br />
<br />
Some tips:<br />
<br />
- You can add Fireworks Tap Toy to your home screen on iOS or Android. If you do that, it'll behave more like a normal app. (I did the extra bit of work to make this a "progressive web app")<br />
<br />
- If you give this to a kid, you can use <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202612">Guided Access</a> to prevent them from leaving the app<br />

I use this trick when I can't remember a name I used to know. It works for names of actors, teachers, friends of friends, etc.<br />
<br />
The trick:<br />
<br />
First, try to remember as much as you can about the person. Imagine their face, appearance, and other biographical information.<br />
<br />
Then go through the alphabet saying a name for each letter. Try to pick names that are as plausible as possible for the person you're trying to remember.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
What was my old roommate's girlfriend's name?<br />
<br />
She was from Connecticut, they dated for a few years, she had long dark hair, she was allergic to dogs, she worked as an accountant, ...<br />
<br />
A... Ashley<br />

<a href='p/pi-emscripten.html'>Emscripten on Raspberry Pi 400</a>
</h2>
</div>
<img src="/m/raspberry-pi-logo.png">
<div id='postdate'>Posted on 1/15/2023<br />
Tags: <a href='/tags.html'>Programming</a>, <a href='/tags.html'>Raspberry Pi</a></div>
I recently completed a harrowing journey to install Emscripten on a Raspberry Pi 400. There were many hiccups along the way that brought back bad memories from the ~8 years that I used Linux (4 on Gentoo, 4 on Debian) as my daily driver OS.<br />
<br />
If you're running a well-trodden configuration, things work pretty smoothly. If you're running anything else, you'll spend hours, days, or even years with systems that aren't working 100%.<br />
<br />
For Emscripten, Raspberry Pi 400 is not a well-trodden configuration.<br />
<br />
Emscripten provides official binaries for many configurations and I bet the <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#sdk-download-and-install">official tutorial</a> goes really quickly and smoothly if you are running an x64 CPU.<br />
<br />
They even provide binaries if you're running an arm64 CPU, just install using this command (see <a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk/issues/547">this ticket</a> for more info):<br />
<div id='code'>./emsdk install latest-arm64-linux</div>
But if you are running a 32-bit Intel-based (x86) or ARM CPU, then you will need to build from source.<br />
<br />
Raspberry Pi 400 is a 32-bit ARM CPU so I found myself needing to build from source.<br />
<br />
And, at least on my machine, the default commands did not work.<br />
<br />
(I also tried to get Emscripten installed in the iSH iOS app, which emulates an x86 CPU. The emsdk script spent hours cloning the LLVM repository and then started building from source but iSH consistently crashed early in the build process. I gave up. It's possible this will work in the future.)<br />
<br />
Here are the steps I followed, what failed, and how I got it working:<br />
<br />
My initial configuration: Raspberry Pi 400 running the Buster (Debian 10) version of Raspbian that came with the SD card. I had installed some packages for other purposes so it's possible I won't mention some packages vital to making these steps work.<br />
<br />
I needed to install one package:<br />
<div id='code'>sudo apt-get install cmake</div>
I think that the resources emscripten pulls plus the intermediate build products can end up taking tens of gigs of storage (I only checked once during build and it was 22GB). I didn't have that much free space on the Raspberry Pi's SD card so I used a USB-C external drive. My external drive is formatted exfat.<br />
<br />
The exfat filesystem doesn't support symlinks and building will fail hours into the process because of that:<br />
<div id='code'>[ 50%] Linking CXX shared library ../../lib/libLTO.so<br />
CMake Error: failed to create symbolic link &#039;../../lib/libLTO.so&#039;: operation not permitted<br />
CMake Error: cmake_symlink_library: System Error: Operation not permitted<br />
make[2]: *** [tools/lto/CMakeFiles/LTO.dir/build.make:168: lib/libLTO.so.16git] Error 1<br />
make[2]: *** Deleting file &#039;lib/libLTO.so.16git&#039;<br />
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:17719: tools/lto/CMakeFiles/LTO.dir/all] Error 2<br />
make: *** [Makefile:152: all] Error 2<br />
Build failed due to exception!</div>
Instead of reformatting my external drive, I created a very large disk image on it which I formatted as ext4:<br />
<div id='code'># 200GB image - I think this is overkill but I wasn&#039;t willing to fail because of insufficient disk space<br />
# Some guides suggest using the fallocate command to create a disk image but I found that command does not work when writing to an exfat drive<br />
dd if=/dev/zero of=image.iso bs=1G count=200<br />
<br />
# Format the image ext4<br />
mkfs.ext4 -j image.iso</div>
Then I mounted the disk image and gave the pi user full ownership:<br />
<div id='code'>cd /media/<br />
sudo mkdir emscripten-disk<br />
sudo mount /path/to/image.iso emscripten-disk<br />
cd emscripten-disk<br />
sudo chown -R pi:pi .</div>
Within that directory, I ran this:<br />
<div id='code'>git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git<br />
cd emsdk<br />
./emsdk install sdk-upstream-main-32bit -j1</div>
The "-j1" argument forces the build to use only one CPU. When I originally attempted to install without that argument, the build failed with very little feedback. Just this generic error, no specific compiler errors:<br />
<div id='code'>Error 2<br />
Build failed due to exception!</div>
I think this is caused by the machine running out of memory (or maybe some other kind of compiler crash).<br />
<br />
Of course, building with only one CPU makes this whole process take much longer. It took ~16 hours for everything to build.<br />
<br />
When the build completes, run this:<br />
<div id='code'>./emsdk activate sdk-upstream-main-32bit</div>
Pay attention to the output of that command because it tells you how to add the right directories to PATH for emcc to be found.<br />
<br />
After all that, following the <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html#tutorial">official tutorial</a>, I created hello_world.c and tested the compiler:<br />
<div id='code'>emcc hello_world.c<br />
node a.out.js</div>
And I got this error:<br />
<div id='code'>/path/to/a.out.js:144<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throw ex;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^<br />
ReferenceError: globalThis is not defined</div>
This is because Buster's version of nodejs is 10.24.0, a version before globalThis is supported.<br />
<br />
This command did produce hello.html which worked as expected in my browser:<br />
<div id='code'>emcc hello_world.c -o hello.html</div>
To get node working, I needed to update my Raspberry Pi to Bullseye (Debian 11). I followed <a href="https://raspberrytips.com/update-raspberry-pi-latest-version/">this guide</a>.<br />
<br />
This was an arduous process of running apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, rebooting, manually editing /etc/apt/sources.list, apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, rebooting, apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, apt-get install nodejs, babysitting all of these commands because some of them require user input, losing SSH access as a result of some updates (make sure to run these commands inside screen or tmux!), physically accessing the device to restart sshd, etc.<br />
<br />
Finally at the end of it, this command worked:<br />
<div id='code'>node a.out.js<br />
(output) Hello, world!</div>
Hopefully these steps work for you!<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>Other Useful Info</h3><br />
If at any point you need to clean build, you can do this:<br />
<div id='code'>rm -rf llvm/git/build_main_32</div>
I had to do this once when figuring out the workaround for the exfat symlink issue. If you change the directory emsdk is running in between attempts, the build scripts will not let you pick up where you left off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's what got me up to the compiling phase in the iSH app on iPad:<br />
<br />
apk add cmake<br />
apk add make<br />
apk add clang<br />
apk add binutils<br />
apk add libc-dev<br />
apk add gcc<br />
apk add libstdc++6<br />
apk add g++<br />
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git<br />
cd emsdk<br />
./emsdk install sdk-upstream-master-32bit<br />
(note that this will take HOURS to clone LLVM)<br />
Progress compiling got to 2% and then iSH crashes.<br />
<br />

With a toddler at home, we've come to rely on DoorDash as a quick way for the adults to eat tasty food.<br />
<br />
We're lucky to live in an area densely packed with restaurants. Despite the wealth of options, we often struggle to choose when dinnertime arrives.<br />
<br />
My spouse and I will end up naming restaurants, taking turns rejecting options one-by-one. On some days, nothing sounds good. On some days, we're exhausted from a night of interrupted sleep and lack the energy to pick. Often both.<br />
<br />
I got the idea to make picking a restaurant more mechanical on the hard days.<br />
<br />
At first, I considered building a web app with a database and a nice UI for listing restaurants and saving our history. I spend most of my non-work hours taking care of the baby, exercising, or doing chores so even a simple side-project takes months and comes at the cost of precious sleep hours. I needed a lower-effort way to test the idea.<br />
<br />
I realized I could make this tool in a shared spreadsheet. I used Numbers on iPhone/iPad and shared the sheet with my spouse using iCloud. Google Sheets could've worked too. Spreadsheets are a great low-effort way to solve problems without writing code. I bet a lot of software engineers underutilize spreadsheets.<br />
<br />
Here's how it works:<br />
- Add a row for every restaurant<br />
- Have a column for the last time we ate there<br />
- Have a column for each person with an estimate of how often they are willing to eat at each particular restaurant<br />
- Have a column to note any restaurants someone is actively in the mood to eat at<br />
- The sheet calculates a recommendation for each row:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Too soon: neither person is ready to eat there again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Let's eat (green): both people are ready OR someone is in the mood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Maybe eat (yellow): one person is ready<br />
- At dinnertime, peruse the green and yellow rows to pick efficiently<br />

Introducing my latest project: <a href="/m/taptoy/index.html">Tap Toy</a><br />
<br />
Tap Toy is a fun little web app for relaxation. Tap the screen to launch some characters which then bounce off each other. Turn on sound for satisfying sound effects and relaxing public-domain background music. In some ways, I think this toy brings the catharsis of popping bubble wrap to your touch screen.<br />
<br />
I got the idea for this project after watching my then-9-month-old's fascination with my iPhone and iPad. Note that the CDC guidelines recommend "no screen time for children younger than 2 years" (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/downloads/15_256312-A_May_LicensingDocument_Final_508_508tagged.pdf">source</a>, <a href="/m/cdc_screentime.pdf">backup</a>) but these kids will still find a way to grab your device for a fleeting moment before you take it back.<br />
<br />
I wondered if I could make an app to soothe and distract our baby if we ever became truly desperate for a moment of peace. (Fortunately, we still haven't reached this point yet!)<br />
<br />
I modeled some of the behavior after <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Einstein-Along-Tunes-Musical/dp/B000YDDF6O">Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes</a>, one of the more pleasant sound-making toys we have:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/babyeinsteintunes.jpg"><br />
The result, as my wife described it, is "crack". She was having a bad day when Tap Toy was first ready to play with and she ended up zoning out, addicted, tapping it for 30 minutes while some of her stress melted away.<br />
<br />
As is usual for me, this side-project is a remix of a few other projects:<br />
<br />
- <a href="http://magickeyboard.io">MagicKeyboard.io</a> (<a href="/m/magickeyboard/index.html">backup</a>, <a href="https://github.com/feross/magickeyboard.io">source</a>) by <a href="http://feross.org">Feross Aboukhadijeh</a><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In fact, I kept the keyboard triggers to launch sprites from the right location along the bottom of the screen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I fixed the sound effect code and added background music<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I also added real multi-touch and mouse support<br />
<br />

After defining the <a href="/p/pceimage.html">PCEImage specification</a>, I wanted to create a great code editor that can color each character in the image.<br />
<br />
<a href="/m/pceimage/index.html">Try out the editor in your browser</a> or read on for more details.<br />
<br />
I was inspired by the <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html?hack=6994394">PuzzleScript editor</a> (mentioned in my <a href="/p/puzzlescript.html">post about PuzzleScript</a>), especially how sprites are defined and styled. Whereas PuzzleScript sprites use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_color">indexed color</a>, PCEImage can use almost any ASCII character as a pixel so I couldn't just reuse the same editor.<br />
<br />
I could reuse the same foundations, though! PuzzleScript's editor is built using <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a>, an open-source text editor implemented in JavaScript for the browser.<br />
<br />
CodeMirror is super customizable and I was able to add the coloring support I needed by writing a <a href="/m/pceimage/editor/parser.js">parser</a> and making some changes to <a href="/m/pceimage/editor/codemirror.js">codemirror.js</a>.<br />
<br />
I also added support to the editor to automatically generate PNGs and, to add a little fun, wobbling GIFs.<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/pceimage/koffing.gif"><br />
For the wobble effect, I was inspired by <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=40058">Wobblepaint</a> (mentioned in my <a href="/p/pico8.html">PICO-8 post</a>) and did my best to try to capture the same organic and charming wobble <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=1">zep</a> invented.<br />
<br />
I also included some "Color Utilites" on the editor page: a simple color picker, a button to invoke your system color picker, and some example palettes (including PICO-8's). Check out <a href="https://lospec.com/palette-list">Lospec's Palette List</a> for even more ideas.<br />
<br />
If you create any cool PCEImages, I hope you'll consider <a href="https://github.com/memalign/memalign.github.io/edit/master/m/pceimage/Images.js">submitting a pull request</a> to add your example! I'll find some way to credit the submitters on the page if I get any!<br />

I recently needed to make pixel art for a game and wanted to define the images in code rather than having separate image asset files.<br />
<br />
Defining the images in code comes with some benefits:<br />
- I don't need separate versions of the images for different resolutions. I can easily scale them up automatically.<br />
- I can easily slice the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)">sprites</a> to animate them programmatically<br />
- I can make minor tweaks with a text editor (my tool of choice! I am much more at home in a text editor than image editing software)<br />
- I get useful diffs when changing images in <a href="/p/source-control.html">source control</a><br />
<br />
To achieve this, I created a simple format I'm calling "PCEImage" (which is short for "Pixel-Character Encoded Image"). Here's what it looks like:<br />
<br />
<div id='code'>.:#00000000<br />
@:#444444<br />
#:#5555FF<br />
<br />
.......<br />
.@.@...<br />
.@.@...<br />
.@.@...<br />
.@@@.#.<br />
.@.@...<br />
.@.@.#.<br />
.@.@.#.<br />
.@.@.#.<br />
.......</div>
Here's that image as a PNG (drawn with scale 10):<br />
<img src="/m/pceimage/hi.png">A neat benefit of this encoding is that the images are also ASCII art -- it's easy to see what a PCEImage looks like even without coloring. In fact, this format is a combination of ASCII art and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_color">indexed color</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>PCEImage Format Specification</h3><br />
The first section of a PCEImage defines what color each character represents. Each line in this section looks like: CHARACTER:HEXCOLOR<br />
Then there's one blank line.<br />
Then the second section is the image itself. Every character in this section (except for the newline at the end of each line) represents a pixel in the image. Every line in this section should be the same length (the width of the image).<br />
There should not be a newline character after the last pixel character on the last line.<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>PCEImage Reference Implementation</h3><br />
I wrote a reference implementation of this specification in JavaScript <a href="/m/pceimage/PCEImage.js">here</a>.<br />
<br />
I had a little fun and also added a wobble mode (similar to <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=40058">Wobblepaint</a>, mentioned in my <a href="/p/pico8.html">PICO-8 post</a>).<br />

I've had the Beatles on my mind recently thanks to the buzz around Peter Jackson's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back">The Beatles: Get Back</a>" documentary.<br />
<br />
I grew up long after the Beatles had broken up and I had never listened to a full Beatles album despite liking a lot of their songs. I decided to listen to every album in order, looking up interesting details about the albums and songs on Wikipedia along the way. (I wish there were more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-Up_Video">pop-up videos</a>!)<br />
<br />
I now have a lot more appreciation for the Beatles members as people, how hard-working they were, and how their music evolved.<br />
<br />
Here are my Beatles picks (in no particular order). Many of these songs are so popular that I already knew them; others I heard for the first time during this listen-through. I left off some songs (Hey Jude, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, and many more) that are objectively good but that I don't like enough to consider "my picks". Some of these songs are funny (such as Norwegian Wood, Michelle, Girl (how a pained John Lennon sucks in air through his teeth), Getting Better), some are just fun, and others are among the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.<br />

I still enjoy <a href="/p/similar-songs.html">finding songs that sound similar</a>.<br />
<br />
I recently listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQA59IkCF5I">Dear Prudence</a> by The Beatles and could've sworn I had heard the chord progression somewhere before. I searched online and found that I probably heard it in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAfyFTzZDMM">Beautiful</a> by Christina Aguilera. The website that gave me this connection is <a href="https://www.soundsjustlike.com/">SoundsJustLike.com</a>.<br />
<br />
SoundsJustLike.com is pretty cool with a long list of user-submitted song connections. Unfortunately, it's hard to search for a specific song. To make it easier, I created <a href="/m/similarsongs.html">this one-page snapshot</a> of all the songs users have submitted.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of great songs on there to explore!<br />

<a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/">PuzzleScript</a> is a way to make tile-based games that run on the web. It was <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/Documentation/about.html">created</a> by <a href="https://www.increpare.com/">increpare</a>.<br />
<br />
An interesting tidbit from the <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/Documentation/credits.html">credits</a> page: PuzzleScript's creator is/was flatmates with <a href="https://terrycavanaghgames.com/">Terry Cavanagh</a>, who made a bunch of popular and creative games: <a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a>, <a href="http://superhexagon.com/">Super Hexagon</a>, and (my favorite) <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dont-look-back/id568668228">Don't Look Back</a>.<br />
<br />
The PuzzleScript games I've seen usually have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">Sokoban</a> elements: pushing/moving crates to solve puzzles. The wrong moves can make a level unbeatable so another core element of PuzzleScript games is unlimited undo by pressing 'z'.

<h3>Notable Games</h3><br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=d210a5248fa713153950"><img src="/m/puzzlescript/sokoboros/sokoboros.gif"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=d210a5248fa713153950">Sokoboros</a></h4> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/sokoboros/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
I enjoyed this game the most. Sokoboros combines elements of Sokoban and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake</a>. The game's name is a clever pun that combines "Sokoban" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros">Ouroboros</a>"!<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6994394"><img src="/m/puzzlescript/atlasshrank/atlasshrank.gif"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6994394">Atlas Shrank</a></h4> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/atlasshrank/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
I enjoyed this game where you play as the Greek Titan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)">Atlas</a> who has been shrunken down and needs to escape a series increasingly complex of rooms.<br />
<br />

This <a href="https://pixelverse.org/files/06c9d85eae32d864c4788e40a1882614-10.html">Zelda-inspired</a> game is made by <a href="https://pixelverse.org/">Joshua Minor</a>. Joshua's <a href="http://twitter.com/jminor">twitter</a> feed has led me to many interesting projects and ideas, including PuzzleScript and <a href="/p/pico8.html">PICO-8</a>! If not for him, these posts wouldn't exist. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-minor-972851">LinkedIn</a>, Joshua's been an engineer at Pixar for 21 years at the time of writing. How cool!<br />

<h4><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=11358856">Collapse</a></h4> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/collapse/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
Terry Cavanagh made this game. I'm reminded slightly of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dont-look-back/id568668228">Don't Look Back</a>: the main character is navigating a hellish and dangerous world to retrieve something beautiful.<br />

<h4><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6846450">Love and Pieces</a></h4> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/loveandpieces/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
Love and Pieces is made by Lexaloffle / Zep, the creator of <a href="/p/pico8.html">PICO-8</a>!<br />

<h3>Some Technical Details</h3><br />
<br />
PuzzleScript <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript">source code</a> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/puzzlescript.zip">backup</a>) reveals some cool details:<br />
- PuzzleScript has its own web-based <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html?hack=6994394">code editor</a>. I particularly like how it displays colors for the sprite pixels defined in text.<br />
- Instead of hosting its own database of games, it integrates with GitHub's gist API. Every game is just stored in a gist in a user's GitHub account. For example, Atlas Shrank's gist is <a href="https://api.github.com/gists/6994394">here</a>. This is an interesting and clever way to avoid hosting your own server.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- The code to post a new gist can be found in the shareClick function <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript/blob/master/src/js/toolbar.js">here</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- The code to load a gist can be found in the getData function <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript/blob/master/src/play.html">here</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- play.html loads whatever gist id is appended to the url (which looks like: <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6994394">https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6994394</a>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I think there's a risk loading content this way: it could look like the website owner published content when really it was published by someone else. The content could be offensive or harmful. To mitigate this, if I use this technique in a project I will probably show a disclaimer on the website that this content is from an external user with a direct link to that user's gist.
