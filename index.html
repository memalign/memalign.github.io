<a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/">PuzzleScript</a> is a way to make tile-based games that run on the web. It was <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/Documentation/about.html">created</a> by <a href="https://www.increpare.com/">increpare</a>.<br />
<br />
An interesting tidbit from the <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/Documentation/credits.html">credits</a> page: PuzzleScript's creator is/was flatmates with <a href="https://terrycavanaghgames.com/">Terry Cavanagh</a>, who made a bunch of popular and creative games: <a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a>, <a href="http://superhexagon.com/">Super Hexagon</a>, and (my favorite) <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dont-look-back/id568668228">Don't Look Back</a>.<br />
<br />
The PuzzleScript games I've seen usually have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">Sokoban</a> elements: pushing/moving crates to solve puzzles. The wrong moves can make a level unbeatable so another core element of PuzzleScript games is unlimited undo by pressing 'z'. Explore the <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/Gallery/index.html">gallery</a> and check out increpare's <a href="https://www.increpare.com/">portfolio of games</a>.<br />

I enjoyed this game the most. Sokoboros combines elements of Sokoban and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake</a>. The game's name is a clever pun that combines "Sokoban" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros">Ouroboros</a>"!<br />

I enjoyed this game where you play as the Greek Titan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)">Atlas</a> who has been shrunken down and needs to escape a series increasingly complex of rooms.<br />

This <a href="https://pixelverse.org/files/06c9d85eae32d864c4788e40a1882614-10.html">Zelda-inspired</a> game is made by <a href="https://pixelverse.org/">Joshua Minor</a>. Joshua's <a href="http://twitter.com/jminor">twitter</a> feed has led me to many interesting projects and ideas, including PuzzleScript and <a href="/p/pico8.html">PICO-8</a>! If not for him, these posts wouldn't exist. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-minor-972851">LinkedIn</a>, Joshua's been an engineer at Pixar for 21 years at the time of writing. How cool!<br />

<h3>Some Technical Details</h3><br />
<br />
PuzzleScript <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript">source code</a> (<a href="/m/puzzlescript/puzzlescript.zip">backup</a>) reveals some cool details:<br />
- PuzzleScript has its own web-based <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html?hack=6994394">code editor</a>. I particularly like how it displays colors for the sprite pixels defined in text.<br />
- Instead of hosting its own database of games, it integrates with GitHub's gist API. Every game is just stored in a gist in a user's GitHub account. For example, Atlas Shrank's gist is <a href="https://api.github.com/gists/6994394">here</a>. This is an interesting and clever way to avoid hosting your own server.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- The code to post a new gist can be found in the shareClick function <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript/blob/master/src/js/toolbar.js">here</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- The code to load a gist can be found in the getData function <a href="https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript/blob/master/src/play.html">here</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- play.html loads whatever gist id is appended to the url (which looks like: <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6994394">https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6994394</a>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I think there's a risk loading content this way: it could look like the website owner published content when really it was published by someone else. The content could be offensive or harmful. To mitigate this, if I use this technique in a project I will probably show a disclaimer on the website that this content is from an external user with a direct link to that user's gist.

The Chex cereal pieces in official store-bought Chex Mix are not the same as the pieces you get in cereal boxes!<br />
<br />
Just take a look at the photo above. The Wheat Chex on the left is from a bag of Chex Mix. The Wheat Chex on the right is from a cereal box.<br />
<br />
Notice how the cereal box one is flatter, denser, has little rectangular holes instead of little square ones.<br />
<br />
The taste and texture of the Chex are different too. The one from the Chex Mix tastes better and has a more pleasant crunch.<br />
<br />
One may be optimized for delicious dry snackiness while the other is optimized for being eaten in milk.<br />
<br />
It's interesting to know we can't replicate store-bought Chex Mix at home because the Chex we can buy make for an inferior snack!

<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a> is a way to make "retro"-style games and then play them anywhere, including on the web.<br />
<br />
PICO-8 initially caught my eye with a few beautiful pixelated games and graphics. Just look at the delightful screen capture of <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145">Celeste</a> above.<br />
<br />
Here's what I love about this platform:<br />
<br />
- Thanks to web technologies, these games can be played anywhere. They work great on touchscreens on iOS and Android. They work great with keyboard and mouse.<br />
<br />
- I love the aesthetic of these games: the low resolution, the 16-color palette. It's inspiring to see how expressive people have been despite (and thanks to) these limitations.<br />
<br />
- Another limitation is code size. This usually means the games are bite-sized and can be played and beaten in a sitting.<br />
<br />
- These limitations are chosen on purpose and are part of the magic. From the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/info.php">about</a> page for PICO-8's website: "Lexaloffle is the home of computer games and fantasy consoles made by <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=1">Joseph White</a>, whose principle mission is to seek out and explore mathematically cute sets of rules that somehow give rise to thematically cute game worlds."<br />
<br />
- My taste in games is trapped in the past, probably the SNES era. Even though SNES was slightly before my time, I've had a blast playing those games. In comparison, games that push the limits of today's hardware are impressive but they are too complex for me. What truly brings me joy are simple "retro"-style games.<br />
<br />
- PICO-8 introduced me to the concept of a game "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake#Demakes">demake</a>". When creating a demake, people boil a game down to its essence. They create a game with the same feel or personality as the original game but smaller and much simpler, usually with simpler graphics. My favorite right now is <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=29590">Picopolis</a>, a demake of Sim City.<br />
<br />
- PICO-8 games are distributed as PNG "virtual cartridges" with the code embedded in the cartridge image itself. The images look like the physical game cartridges of the 1980s and 90s. How delightful! You can see examples below.<br />
<br />
- The creator of PICO-8, <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=1">Joseph White</a> aka "zep" (<a href="https://twitter.com/lexaloffle">twitter</a>), is a prolific software developer. He came up with the idea for PICO-8 and then built all of the development tools for editing code, music, sound effects, graphics, etc. In addition to creating PICO-8, he also built the BBS website where users post, comment on, and collaborate on games. The community is very creative and positive. He's made his own games such as <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=40058">Wobblepaint</a>. He has other projects too, which you can learn about on <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/">lexaloffle.com</a>.<br />

Here are some of my favorite games so far:<br />
<br />
<h3>Demakes and Remakes</h3><br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=29590"><img src="/m/pico8/picopolis/42427.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=29590">Picopolis</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/picopolis/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
Demake of Sim City. Usually Sim City has no win condition and I like how the author gave us some way to declare victory: by building a $10 million "Victory Monument". Playing this scratched the itch I had to play classic Sim City. Picopolis is made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Bergensten">Jens Bergensten</a> (aka Jeb) who's best known for significant contributions to Minecraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=mb_advent2019"><img src="/m/pico8/snowfight/mb_advent2019-2.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=mb_advent2019">Snowfight</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/snowfight/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
This is a remake of an old Flash game winter holidays greeting card. Even the same winning strategy works as it did on the original game. Major nostalgic fun :)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=97365"><img src="/m/pico8/sonic16x16/8JwsJq.gif"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=97365">Sonic16x16</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/sonic16x16/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
I love this! Great example of a demake. Sonic is only 2 pixels and yet anyone who's played a side-scrolling Sonic game will recognize the feel of the game, the music, and the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Hill_Zone">Green Hill Zone</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=98070"><img src="/m/pico8/rtype/rtype-2.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=98070">R-Type</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/rtype/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
Intensely challenging remake of the classic side-scrolling shoot'em up game. Fortunately there's a cheat mode! <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=11437"><img src="/m/pico8/picoman/22937.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=11437">Pico-Man</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/picoman/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
A clone of Pac-Man. Thoroughly enjoyable just like the original. One user commented, "more proof that games just look cuter on the PICO :3".<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://pahammond.itch.io/phoenix"><img src="/m/pico8/phoenix/phoenix08-0.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://pahammond.itch.io/phoenix">Phoenix</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/phoenix/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
My introduction to Phoenix-style games was in <a href="/p/draw-shapes.html">MirageOS on a TI calculator</a>. It turns out Phoenix was originally an arcade game and this is a more faithful remake.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://pahammond.itch.io/lode-runner"><img src="/m/pico8/loderunner/loderunner08-1.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://pahammond.itch.io/lode-runner">Lode Runner</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/loderunner/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
A clone of Lode Runner. Classic :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://freds72.itch.io/poom"><img src="/m/pico8/poom/poom.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://freds72.itch.io/poom">Poom</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/poom/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
A port of Doom. No platform is complete without one of these! This port really pushes the limits of PICO-8 and works around some of the limitations by splitting its code across several cartridges and then seamlessly jumping between them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=43692"><img src="/m/pico8/picones/picones_0_0_1-0.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=43692">Picones</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/picones/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
This is a work-in-progress demake of Lumines. The mechanics aren't perfect and the iconic and addictive music and sound effects are missing but this still satisfied my craving for some Lumines action! That's particularly helpful because Lumines is one of those games that has been released several times as a new iOS app only to be abandoned and broken a few years later.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h4>Teaser: <a href="https://twitter.com/johanpeitz/status/1438898759484780547?s=20">Metroid</a></h4><br />
This demake isn't available to play (yet?) but it looks SO GOOD!<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3>Platformer/Metroidvania</h3><br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=81448"><img src="/m/pico8/meascastle/meas_castle-12.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=81448">Mea's Castle</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/meascastle/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
Really fun Metroid-style game. I played through in one sitting and had a blast :) There were some jumps that were tricky (and frustrating) using the touch controls which might be easier with a keyboard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=38333"><img src="/m/pico8/spellouttahere/witchescape3-5.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=38333">Get Me the Spell Outta Here!!</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/spellouttahere/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
Another fun Metroid-style game. You're a witch who uses a growing repertoire of spells to navigate a castle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145"><img src="/m/pico8/celeste/15133.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145">Celeste</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/celeste/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
Hardcore platformer that was made in four days as part of a game jam. Very impressive! It was ultimately fleshed out into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)">full commercially successful game</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=86783"><img src="/m/pico8/celeste2/celeste_classic_2-5.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=86783">Celeste 2</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/celeste2/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
A follow-up game with slightly different mechanics. Also tricky and fun like the original.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=48475"><img src="/m/pico8/metrocubevania/cubevania12-0.p8.png"></a><br />
<h4><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=48475">MetroCUBEvania</a></h4> (<a href="/m/pico8/metrocubevania/index.html">backup</a>)<br />
Play as a bouncing cube gaining new abilities as the game progresses.<br />
<br />

Fairly complete RPG! I like the world and the quests. I don't like how many times I had to play the mini-game. I almost gave up when I was just about to beat the game because I found the mini-game so tedious. It reminded me of how many Zubat you have to fight in Pokémon caves. Grind through and you'll beat the game.<br />

Do you have a fussy infant?<br />
<br />
Here's my checklist for trying to resolve fussiness:<br />
<br />
- Does the baby need a diaper change? Check for diaper rash - make sure to slather on extra diaper paste if you see redness/bumps. I saw one website say you should spread it on as if "icing a cake". Our first few diaper rashes were caused by the diaper being too small - check whether the next size up is a better fit!<br />
<br />
- Does the baby want a pacifier?<br />
<br />
- Is the baby hungry? Try offering a bottle even if they recently ate. They might be going through a growth spurt.<br />
<br />
- Does the baby need to burp? Try holding them upright and patting their back.<br />
<br />
- They might be uncomfortable. Try holding the baby in different positions.<br />
<br />
- The baby might be overstimulated after a long and interesting day. Try darkening the room and make it quiet. Try putting them down for sleep. Try putting them in a bouncer. Try putting them on your chest for a rest.<br />
<br />
- If you're feeling overwhelmed or desperate, tag your partner in for help!<br />
<br />
- Echoing advice from our pediatrician: If your baby won't stop crying no matter what you try and you're at your wit's end, call your pediatrician. Your baby could be telling you something more serious. WebMD has some <a href="https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/why-baby-cries#1">additional advice</a>.

I've always had a hard time <a href="/p/emoji-conway.html">falling asleep</a>. Closing my eyes invites a whirlwind of thoughts. I can't stop thinking so I can't fall asleep.<br />
<br />
Then I found a way to clear my head and fall asleep quickly. It's been working for months now!<br />
<br />
Here's what I do:<br />
<br />
As I shower and brush my teeth before bed, I spend that ~30 minutes clearing my head. When I notice a thought, I think "ah" and let the thought go, let it dissipate and fade. This isn't the time for thinking and problem solving, it's the time to empty my mind so I can fall asleep.<br />
<br />
I repeat this for every thought that creeps in. I've found it also helps to focus on my immediate senses to keep my head emptier: the sound of the toothbrush, the soap/water/friction on my hands. I'm grounded in the present. I'm not thinking about these sounds and feelings; I'm just experiencing them without commentary.<br />
<br />
Sometimes this helps me notice a feeling of muscle tightness. Maybe I'm furrowing my brow or frowning. Maybe I have tightness in my shoulders. I release the tension and physically relax.<br />
<br />
I continue this meditation as I slide into bed until I fall asleep. And I continue it if I wake up in the middle of the night.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/horizontalseparator.png"><br />
<br />
I don't know if this technique is real "meditation" in the Zen Buddhism sense but I was inspired to try it after, months ago, stumbling upon <a href="https://nkanaev.com/zen101/en/">101 Zen Stories</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101_Zen_Stories">Wikipedia</a>). (Warning: these are old and may contain antiquated or even racist terms)<br />
<br />
I don't understand them even though they are simple. I tried to search for answers about one of the more famous stories: <a href="https://nkanaev.com/zen101/en/021/">The Sound of One Hand</a> (<a href="/m/sound-of-one-hand.html">mirror</a>).<br />
<br />
I found a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-behind-What-is-the-sound-of-one-hand-clapping">Quora thread</a> with some discussion. No answer was perfectly satisfying but two similar posts stood out:<br />
<br />
Khiêm Bảo Thiện: <br />
<blockquote>However, when one asks you about one hand clapping - which is extraordinary, uncommon, unseen, not understandable - your mind starts to set on a quest for answer, which raises a lot of noises, like you throw a big rock into a tranquil lake. ... So, using this koan and similar, for certain situations, helps the learner realize his/her mind's activities.</blockquote>
Chris Peters:<br />
<blockquote>The idea behind this phrase is not literal, but is meant to "blend" your mind Matrix-style and hopefully trick you into observing your mind as it kinda freaks out.</blockquote>
Is the key to enlightenment learning to notice your thoughts and then clear your head? Who knows. I certainly feel lighter when my head is clear, my muscles are relaxed, and I float off to sleep.

A friend of ours shared the eulogy he gave for his dad. In it, he quoted a lesson his father taught him as a kid:<br />
<blockquote>Watch your thoughts, they become words;<br />
watch your words, they become actions;<br />
watch your actions, they become habits;<br />
watch your habits, they become character;<br />
watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.</blockquote>
(This quote and ones with a similar sentiment are often attributed to many different sources. Ultimately, the original is by Frank Outlaw based on <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/01/10/watch-your-thoughts/">Quote Investigator</a>'s research.)<br />
<br />
I don't think I was taught to watch my thoughts as a kid. At least not in a way that was effective for me.<br />
<br />
I was taught that particular actions are bad and why they are bad.<br />
<br />
I was taught that jealousy, intolerance, hate, etc are bad.<br />
<br />
But I didn't realize that the way I choose to think about things can have a big impact on long-term happiness and fulfillment in life. On friendships and relationships too.<br />
<br />
I realized in adulthood that being happy is a choice much of the time. A choice made every day. Focusing on the positive (and even helping to amplify it) can do a lot to diminish the negative: disappointment, annoyance, frustration, misfortune.<br />
<br />
Of course, really bad things happen sometimes and you can't just ignore them. It wouldn't be healthy to try to force yourself to be happy when you're truly hurting. But for all the small bad things, with practice it's possible to decide how much energy to spend thinking about them -- and whether to think about them at all. Sometimes negativity can be self-fulfilling: expecting to have a bad time can lead to having a bad time.<br />
<br />
This is similar to what I'm trying to say in <a href="/p/day-and-night.html">Day and Night</a>. Thinking envious thoughts leads to envious actions. Comparing yourself to others leads to unempathetic behaviors. And envious actions, unempathetic behaviors lead to a lonely life.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, looking for the good and trying to be truly empathetic can lead to happiness, more positivity, and supportive friendships.

<a href='p/tims-vermeer.html'>Tim's Vermeer</a>

<div id='postdate'>Posted on 9/25/2021<br />

I recently saw <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/restored-vermeer-painting-finally-reveals-hidden-cupid-in-background/">news</a> that a painting from the 1650s had been restored to unhide a painting-within-a-painting in the background.<br />
<br />
Here's what the "after" and "before" look like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/vermeer-after-and-before.jpg"><br />
<br />
It's fascinating that modern technology can both find the hidden painted-over image and confirm that it was painted over by someone other than the artist.<br />
<br />
I showed my wife who asked "Is that a Vermeer?" which then sent me down another <a href="/p/rabbit-hole.html">rabbit hole</a>.<br />
<br />
I asked "Whoah how could you tell?" and she said that all Vermeer paintings look exactly like this due to similar composition and photo-realistic lighting.<br />
<br />
I found that I was already familiar with one of Vermeer's paintings, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring">Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>, possibly due to its use as an example image in computer vision.<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/912px-1665_Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring.jpg"><br />
<br />
Then I stumbled upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim%27s_Vermeer">Tim's Vermeer</a>, a documentary made by Penn and Teller about an inventor (and successful company founder) named Tim Jenison who had a side-project (bordering on obsession) to understand how Vermeer captured such realistic lighting in paintings and then do so himself.<br />
<br />
He ultimately figured out a combination of two mirrors that enable you to color match what's painted exactly to the real scene. It turns the process of painting a brilliant masterpiece into something mechanical, essentially a manual photograph machine with a person holding a paintbrush in the middle.<br />
<br />
He starts out copying an old black-and-white photograph this way:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/tim-photograph.jpg"><br />
<br />
The results are phenomenal! Tim says this was the first painting he's ever made and it was a wholly mechanical process of copying the color he saw in the mirror.<br />
<br />
After that successful proof of concept, Tim sets out to completely recreate one of Vermeer's most detailed paintings.<br />
<br />
Check out the full documentary (it's only 80 minutes long and you can <a href="/p/speed-up-av.html">watch it faster than 1x</a>) to see how he first replicates the physical space and then reproduces the painting. The painting itself takes 130 days.<br />
<br />
Here are some snapshots of the mirror setup and the final painting:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/tim-mirror-setup.jpg"><br />
<img src="/m/tim-final-painting-closeup.jpg"><br />
<img src="/m/tim-with-painting.jpg"><br />
<br />
By the end of the documentary, I'm convinced that Vermeer used a setup like Tim's. Here's why:<br />
<br />
- At one point, Tim realizes that the mirrors cause slight visual distortion in the form of curving of straight lines. He looks at the original Vermeer and discovers the same distortion!<br />
- The lighting in Vermeer paintings goes beyond what the human visual system can detect across the size of the rooms in the paintings<br />
- The fine detail in the rug in the painting is not perceivable from the artist's distance without the magnifying help of the mirrors<br />
- And several more visual quirks of Vermeer's paintings shown in the documentary<br />
<br />
But don't take my word for it - check it out yourself!

Tap or click and take a trip down memory lane with the historic Lights Off. Exactly fourteen years ago today Wired got the scoop: <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/08/lights-off-first-iphone-native-game-arrives/">Lights Off: First iPhone Native Game Arrives</a>.<br />
<br />
And today I'm sharing a new implementation that everyone can play in their web browser:<br />
<br />
<a href="/m/lightsoff/index.html">Play here!</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Lights Off's story begins with Tiger Electronics who launched their game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)">Lights Out</a> in 1995. Then in 2007 Lucas Newman and Adam Betts cloned the game for the iPhone's touch screen. Notably, they built the game before there was an official iPhone SDK or App Store. It was only available to jailbreakers!<br />
<br />
A year later, <a href="https://twitter.com/chockenberry">Craig Hockenberry</a> wrote a <a href="https://furbo.org/2008/09/19/lights-off/">post</a> to commemorate the milestone and share the <a href="https://github.com/chockenberry/LightsOffTouch/">source code</a> (<a href="/m/lightsoff-orig.zip">my backup</a>).<br />
<br />
Since then the app was rebuilt and modernized by <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith">Steve Troughton-Smith</a> as possibly the <a href="https://twitter.com/bennettk/status/880175781057445888?s=20">oldest</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/880462796286291968?s=20">still-actively-maintained app</a> on the App Store. You can find his version <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lights-off/id292025150">here</a>.<br />
<br />
For more history on the App Store and its first killer apps, check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/06/the-day-that-changed-your-phone-forever/">this article</a> (also written by Craig Hockenberry - <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2018/03/a-lot-can-happen-in-a-decade/">mirror</a> on the iconfactory website).<br />
<br />
<br />
In the process of building the web version, I wrote <a href="/m/lightsoff/unitTests.html">tests</a> (<a href="/m/lightsoff/UnitTests.js">source code</a>) to ensure every level is solvable. To my surprise almost half of the original levels <a href="https://github.com/chockenberry/LightsOffTouch/issues/1">cannot be solved</a>! How cruel! This was probably a mistake in how the levels were generated - maybe by flipping certain lights on without checking that the overall puzzle was valid.<br />
<br />
To replace the bad levels, I generated my own levels of increasing difficulty by ramping up the minimum number of taps required to solve each puzzle. My algorithm can be found in the unit tests code in the "test_generateLevels" method. This could even be hooked into the game itself for an "endless" mode.<br />
<br />
If ever you can't figure out how to solve a level in the fewest taps, there's a guaranteed method to win called "light chasing" or "chase the lights":<br />
- Start on the top row<br />
- For every lit button in the row, turn it off by tapping the button in the row right below it<br />
- Repeat until you get to the bottom row<br />
- At this point, the bottom row will have one of seven patterns. Based on the pattern, tap the specific circled cells on the top row and repeat these steps. By the time you reach the bottom row again, every light will be off!<br />

While every level can be beaten mechanically like this, it's still more fun (and often faster) to find the fewest taps needed! That's the real challenge.<br />

A professor named J. Matthew Register created this formula to make math fun. Here's what he says about the history in a <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-wrote-the-Batman-equation">post on Quora</a>:<br />
"I wrote it many, many years ago. I was teaching at a few art schools throughout the greater Sacramento area, and I used it to engage my students in the topic of graphing. One of my coolest students (Mr. Wilkinson aka i_luv_ur_mom) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/j2qjc/do_you_like_batman_do_you_like_math_my_math/">posted it to Reddit</a> back in 2011 and it went viral. I'm a full time professor over at American River College, doing every thing I can to make math as enjoyable as possible."<br />
<br />
There's a nice breakdown of how the formula's separate pieces come together to make the full shape on <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/54506/is-this-batman-equation-for-real">Math StackExchange</a>.<br />

User copper.hat on Math StackExchange notes why: there are several terms which introduce an imaginary number (by taking sqrt of a negative number). For this reason, the combined formula does not have the solutions required for the necessary range of x and y values. (Wolfram also has a <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BatmanCurve.html">writeup</a> that notes that the Batman Curve is defined piecewise.)<br />
<br />
The original formula uses the trick of undefined/imaginary values to truncate shapes to a specific range of x values. Since this trick breaks the formula, I wondered if it's possible to find a different gadget that could constrain x values without introducing undefined/imaginary values.<br />
<br />
Here's what I came up with:<br />
<div id='code'>For a formula F, constrain its x values to the interval [L, U] with:<br />
<br />
((F)^2 + min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, U-x)))) + min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, L-x))))) = 0</div>
To fix the Batman Curve, I went segment-by-segment applying the gadget. First, I needed to resolve any undefined/imaginary results. Second, I needed to apply my gadget for the relevant x (and sometimes y) ranges.<br />
<br />
Here's the crazy formula I ended up with:<br />
<div id='code'>(((2.25-y)^2+min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 0.5-x))))+min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, -0.5-x))))) * ((abs(x/2)-((3*sqrt(33)-7)/112)*(x^2)-3+sqrt(abs(1-(abs(abs(x)-2)-1)^2))-y)^2 + min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 4-x))))+min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, -4-x)))))) * (((min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 3-x))))+min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 7-x))))) + min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 0-y))))+ (((x/7)^2)+((y/3)^2)-1)) * ((min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 4-x))))+min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 7-x))))) + min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 0-y))))+ (((x/7)^2)+((y/3)^2)-1)) * ((min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 3-(-x)))))+min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 7-(-x)))))) + min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 0-y))))+ (((-x/7)^2)+((y/3)^2)-1)) * ((min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 4-(-x)))))+min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 7-(-x)))))) + min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 0-y))))+ (((-x/7)^2)+((y/3)^2)-1))  +  min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 1-abs(x)))))) * ((min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 3-x))))+min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 1-x))))) +  ((6*sqrt(10)/7+(1.5-0.5*abs(x))  -6*sqrt(10)/14*sqrt(abs(4-(abs(x)-1)^2))-y))^2) * ((min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 3+x))))+min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 1+x))))) +  ((6*sqrt(10)/7+(1.5-0.5*abs(-x))  -6*sqrt(10)/14*sqrt(abs(4-(abs(-x)-1)^2))-y))^2) * ((min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 1-y))))+min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 3-y))))) + (9-8*abs(x)-y)^2) * ((min(1, ceil(abs(max(0, 2.25-y))))+min(1, ceil(abs(min(0, 3-y))))) +  (3*abs(x)+0.75-y)^2) = 0</div>

I'm excited to introduce <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html">FormulaGraph</a>, a graphing calculator for general formulas (not just functions of x)!<br />
<br />
Whereas many graphing calculators require an equation like <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y%20=%20sqrt(1-x%5E2)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=y%20=%20-sqrt(1-x%5E2)&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y = sqrt(1 - x^2)</a>, FormulaGraph can handle formulas like <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y%5E2%20+%20x%5E2%20=%201&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y^2 + x^2 = 1</a>. You don't have to solve for y to use FormulaGraph.<br />
<br />
Here's what else it can do:<br />
<br />
- Polar formulas in terms of r and theta, such as <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=r%20=%202*sin(2*theta)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">r = 2*sin(2*theta)</a><br />
- Animate based on time t: <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y=%20x%5E(t%254)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=false">y = x^(t % 4)</a><br />
- Inequalities: <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=x%5E100%20+%20y%5E100%20%3C=%202&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">x^100 + y^100 <= 2</a><br />
- Handle panning and zooming using mouse and touch/pinch<br />
- Share links<br />
<br />
<br />
While FormulaGraph lacks features other graphing calculators have (such as precisely calculating y- and x-intercepts), it has some unique benefits:<br />
(I introduced this list of calculators <a href="/p/draw-shapes.html">previously</a>)<br />
<br />
- TI-83 Plus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Features only in FormulaGraph: interactive graphs, animate with time, available in any web browser, graph formulas (not just functions)<br />
<br />
- WolframAlpha<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Features only in FormulaGraph: interactive graphs, animate with time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- WolframAlpha won't graph some formulas, e.g. <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y%5E2+x%5Ex=1&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y^2+x^x=1</a> and <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=x%5Ey=x%5Ex%5Ex%5Ex%5Ex%5Ex&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">x^y=x^x^x^x^x^x</a><br />
<br />
- Meta-Calculator<br />

<br />
- FooPlot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Features only in FormulaGraph: animate with time, graph formulas (not just functions), graph inequalities<br />
<br />
- GeoGebra Graphing Calculator<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Features only in FormulaGraph: available in any web browser, graph polar formulas, modulo operator<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- GeoGebra Graphing Calculator won't graph some formulas, e.g. <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=x*y*(x-y)*(x+y)%20%3C%201&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">x*y*(x-y)*(x+y) < 1</a><br />
<br />
- Desmos<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Desmos is really great. It's the best graphing calculator in this list. It can handle formulas, animations, polar formulas, and more!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- One thing FormulaGraph handles better: Desmos doesn't support polar equations which aren't linear in r. Example: <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=r%5E2=cos(theta)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">r^2 = cos(theta)</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Desmos has another quirky inconvenience: it's not possible to copy/paste formulas or easily edit their text. FormulaGraph's formula input boxes are super convenient in comparison. This feature is a must-have to make complex shapes like the <a href="/p/batman-curve.html">Batman Curve</a>.<br />
<br />
- NumWorks Graphing Calculator<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Features only in FormulaGraph: interactive graphs, convenient UI, animate with time, available in any web browser, graph formulas (not just functions), graph polar formulas, graph inequalities<br />
<br />
- Relplot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Features only in FormulaGraph: interactive graphs, animate with time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Relplot has some graphing correctness bugs. Examples: <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y=x%252&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y = x mod 2</a>, <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y=x%5Ex&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y = x^x</a>, <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y%5Ey=x%5Ex&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y^y = x^x</a>, <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=r=2*sin(4*theta)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">r = 2*sin(4*theta)</a>, <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=r=theta&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">r = theta</a> covers a small range of theta values<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I'm reporting these bugs and I hope they get fixed!<br />
<br />
- Graphtoy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Features only in FormulaGraph: graph formulas (not just functions), graph polar formulas, graph inequalities<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Graphtoy has visual glitches (missing segments) when drawing circles and other similar shapes (e.g. <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y=sqrt(1-x%5E2)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=y=-sqrt(1-x%5E2)&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y = sqrt(1-x^2) and y = -sqrt(1-x^2)</a>)<br />
<br />
- Bonus: FormulaGraph has tons of test coverage, including checks that graphs render accurately. You can run the tests <a href="/m/formulagraph/unitTests.html">here</a>. Beware: they take ~1 minute to run!<br />
<br />
<br />
FormulaGraph's origins:<br />
<br />
This is a hobby project I made by combining code and ideas from other peoples' cool projects.<br />
<br />
It all started with <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/w8/~andru/relplot/">Relplot</a>, a project by Cornell's <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/">Andrew Myers</a>. In Professor Myers' functional programming class, we implemented formula plotters using interval arithmetic.<br />
<br />
Over a decade later, I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org">Inigo Quilez</a>'s <a href="https://graphtoy.com/">Graphtoy</a>. I had fun <a href="/p/shape-catalog.html">making shapes</a> and I thought it'd be even more fun to bring Relplot's general formula capabilities to Graphtoy's interactive UI.<br />
<br />
So that's what I did: I ported Relplot's implementation of interval arithmetic from SML to JavaScript and spliced it into Graphtoy. I really appreciate all the work Professor Myers and Inigo did, especially publishing the source code for these projects.<br />
<br />
There was one remaining difficulty: While Graphtoy uses JavaScript's built-in parser for inputted expressions, I needed to completely replace the implementations of operators like +, -, *, /, %. JavaScript doesn't have operator overloading so I needed my own expression parser.<br />
<br />
That's where <a href="https://www.teamten.com/">Lawrence Kesteloot</a>'s awesome web implementation of <a href="https://github.com/lkesteloot/turbopascal">Turbo Pascal</a> (<a href="/m/turbopascal.zip">my backup</a>) comes in (see his interesting <a href="https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/projects/turbo_pascal_compiler/">writeup</a> about the project). I simply copied and reused his expression parser. Thank you Lawrence for building and sharing that passion project! I particularly like that this project has very few dependencies. And I was able to remove the few 3rd party dependencies it had in the portion of code I reused.<br />
<br />
Key integration points where these projects are glued together:<br />
- <a href="/m/formulagraph/relplot.js">relplot.js</a> - look for "MAIntervalMath" for a reimplementation of Relplot's interval arithmetic<br />
- <a href="/m/formulagraph/graphtoy.js">graphtoy.js</a> - look for "Draw Relplot graphs" to see where Relplot was added to Graphtoy<br />
- <a href="/m/formulagraph/utilities.js">utilities.js</a> - look for "_convertFormulaToFnSyntax" to see where the parser comes into play<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some miscellaneous things I've learned during this project:<br />
<br />
- Some equations have solutions that are not clearly visible on most graphing calculators. For example, <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y=x%5Ex&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y = x^x</a> has valid solutions for negative values of x which are single points (e.g. (-1, -1)).<br />
<br />
- New shapes:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y%5E100%20+%20x%5E100%20%3C%201&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">Square</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=x%5E2+(y-(x%5E2)%5E(1/3))%5E2%20%3C%201&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">Heart</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=((x*y*(x-y)*(x+y)*(x%5E2+y%5E2-4))%5E2-1)%3C1&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">Crazy lotus</a><br />
<br />
- Modulo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Create <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=(x%5E2+y%5E2)%2540=1&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">concentric shapes</a> using modulo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Create <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y%20=%20x%5E(t%20%25%203)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=false">repeating animations</a> using modulo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- There are different definitions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">modulo</a> for negative numbers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Many programming languages implement modulo as "truncated division"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Desmos, Relplot, and Graphtoy use "floored division" so I use that in FormulaPlot too<br />
<br />
- How to convert Cartesian coordinates to polar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Based on Relplot's implementation, I thought I just had to replace "r" with "sqrt(x^2+y^2)" and "theta" with "atan2(y, x)".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- This turned out to be much harder than I expected in part because Relplot's polar coodinate support is incomplete (noted above in my comparison of FormulaGraph and Relplot).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- After what I thought would be a 20 minute feature consumed several weekends, I'm reminded of the tongue-in-cheek <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/761656824202276864">Programmers' Credo</a>: "We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I solved this with 3 techniques: graph positive r and negative r (with theta shifted by pi), translate atan2's result range to [0, 2pi] (instead of [-pi, pi]), and iteratively render with theta += 2pi.<br />
<br />
- Debugging an incorrect graph is similar to general debugging. Try to find the simplest case that reproduces the issue. I was relieved when a glitch in <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y%20=%20(mod(floor(x),2))*(x-floor(x))+(1-mod(floor(x),2))*(-x-floor(-x))+(1-mod(floor(x),2))*(1-ceil(x-floor(x)))&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y = (mod(floor(x),2))*(x-floor(x))+(1-mod(floor(x),2))*(-x-floor(-x))+(1-mod(floor(x),2))*(1-ceil(x-floor(x)))</a> reproduced in the far simpler <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y=ceil(x-floor(x))&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y = ceil(x-floor(x))</a>.<br />
<br />
- When using interval arithmetic to graph formulas, it's ok to return wide intervals when the input is wide as long as the result intervals converge as the inputs get smaller. I use this technique to avoid the incorrect vertical line segments some graphing calculators (including Relplot and Graphtoy) show for <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=y=floor(x)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=true">y = floor(x)</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
To conclude, here's an improved version of the <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html?f1(x,t)=&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-(x-0.7)+sqrt(.1)+abs(sin(PI*-(x-0.7)))&v2=false&f3(x,t)=&v3=true&f4(x,t)=y%3C-floor(x)&v4=true&f5(x,t)=(y-(-((t%2519-8)-0.7)+sqrt(.1)+abs(sin(PI*-((t%2519-8)-0.7)))))%5E2+(x-(t%2519-8))%5E2%3C=0.1&v5=true&f6(x,t)=&v6=true&grid=true&coords=0,0,12&paused=false">bouncing ball animation</a> (original <a href="/p/bouncing-ball.html">here</a>).<br />

Happy graphing :)<br />

I mentioned <a href="/p/draw-shapes.html">here</a> that TI calculators can make some simple animations:<br />
"An upperclassman graphed some functions together which made it look like this circle was a ball bouncing down stairs."<br />
<br />
I also mentioned something special about <a href="https://graphtoy.com/">Graphtoy</a>:<br />
"Graphtoy has a variable for elapsed time (t) which can be used to create animations"<br />
<br />
In this post, I'll recreate the bouncing ball animation using mathematical formulas in Graphtoy.<br />
<br />
Browsing our <a href="/p/shape-catalog.html">shape catalog</a> gives us a few useful components:<br />
<br />
Steps: y = floor(x)<br />
<br />
Diagonal sine wave: y = x + 3 + sin(3*x)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- This looks similar to the path of a ball as it bounces down steps<br />
<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=floor(x)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=x+3+sin(3*x)&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Here's what those look like together:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/steps-sine-wave.jpg"><br />
<br />
One aesthetic tweak: have the stairs go down to the right.<br />
Adjust the sine wave to match the direction and slope of the stairs.<br />
<br />
Steps: y = -floor(x)+5<br />
Ball's path: y = -x + 5 + sin(3*-x)<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=-floor(x)+5&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-x+5+sin(3*-x)&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
With a normal (non-diagonal) sine wave, every other hump is negative and below the x-axis. In our diagonal sine wave, every other hump is going under a step instead of bouncing off it.<br />
<br />
Let's figure out how to have a normal sine wave bounce off the x-axis and then bring that same modification to our more complex diagonal sine wave.<br />
<br />
To simply make all negative values positive, we can take the absolute value with the abs() function:<br />
<br />
y = abs(sin(x))<br />
<br />
Here's what that looks like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/sine-abs.jpg"><br />
<br />
Looks promising! Let's try using abs on the diagonal sine wave:<br />
<br />
y = -x + 5 + abs(sin(3*-x))<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=-floor(x)+5&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-x+5+abs(sin(3*-x))&v2=true&f3(x,t)=abs(sin(x))&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Here's what that looks like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/sine-abs-bounce.jpg"><br />
<br />
There are a few problems still:<br />
<br />
- The bounce should happen in the middle of the step (not in the corner)<br />
- It looks like the width of each period of the sine wave is not the same as the length of each step so there's visible drift<br />
<br />
We can fix both of these using techniques noted in the <a href="/p/shape-catalog.html">shape catalog</a>.<br />
<br />
Shift the bounce to happen farther right:<br />
<br />
y = -(x-0.5) + 5 + abs(sin(3*-(x-0.5)))<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=-floor(x)+5&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-(x-0.5)+5+abs(sin(3*-(x-0.5)))&v2=true&f3(x,t)=abs(sin(x))&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Fix the sine wave's period:<br />
<br />
y = -(x-0.5) + 5 + abs(sin(PI*-(x-0.5)))<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=-floor(x)+5&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-(x-0.5)+5+abs(sin(PI*-(x-0.5)))&v2=true&f3(x,t)=abs(sin(x))&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Here's what that looks like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/fixed-period.jpg"><br />
<br />
Now let's add our bouncing ball. We want to draw a circle that's centered on the diagonal bouncing sine wave.<br />
<br />
From the shape catalog, here is the equation for a circle centered at (-3, 2):<br />
<br />
y = sqrt(1 - (x+3)^2) + 2<br />
y = -sqrt(1 - (x+3)^2) + 2<br />
<br />
To have the ball move to the right with time, we'll replace the -3 with t. t is the special parameter Graphtoy provides; its value is the number of seconds that have passed since the webpage refreshed.<br />
<br />
y = sqrt(1 - (x-t)^2) + 2<br />
y = -sqrt(1 - (x-t)^2) + 2<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=-floor(x)+5&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-(x-0.5)+5+abs(sin(PI*-(x-0.5)))&v2=true&f3(x,t)=sqrt(1-(x-t)%5E2)+2&v3=true&f4(x,t)=-sqrt(1-(x-t)%5E2)+2&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
The y-value at time t is the value of our bouncing sine wave when x=t.<br />
<br />
Bouncing sine wave: y = -(x-0.5) + 5 + abs(sin(PI*-(x-0.5)))<br />
<br />
Value when x=t:<br />
y = -(t-0.5) + 5 + abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.5)))<br />
<br />
Now, we'll replace the 2 in our circle equations with this y expression:<br />
<br />
y = sqrt(1 - (x-t)^2) + (-(t-0.5) + 5 + abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.5))))<br />
y = -sqrt(1 - (x-t)^2) + (-(t-0.5) + 5 + abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.5))))<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=-floor(x)+5&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-(x-0.5)+5+abs(sin(PI*-(x-0.5)))&v2=true&f3(x,t)=sqrt(1%20-%20(x-t)%5E2)%20+%20(-(t-0.5)%20+%205%20+%20abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.5))))&v3=true&f4(x,t)=-sqrt(1%20-%20(x-t)%5E2)%20+%20(-(t-0.5)%20+%205%20+%20abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.5))))&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Wow! This is getting really close!<br />
<br />
The ball is way too big. Let's shrink its radius:<br />
<br />
y = sqrt(0.1 - (x-t)^2) + (-(t-0.5) + 5 + abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.5))))<br />
y = -sqrt(0.1 - (x-t)^2) + (-(t-0.5) + 5 + abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.5))))<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=-floor(x)+5&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-(x-0.5)+5+abs(sin(PI*-(x-0.5)))&v2=true&f3(x,t)=sqrt(0.1-(x-t)%5E2)+(-(t-0.5)+5+abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.5))))&v3=true&f4(x,t)=-sqrt(0.1-(x-t)%5E2)+(-(t-0.5)+5+abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.5))))&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
(Note: once the circle moves off-screen, don't forget to reset t (or refresh the page) to make it reappear)<br />
<br />
More tweaks needed:<br />
<br />
- The ball bounces through the step. Need to shift the bouncing curve up by the ball's radius.<br />
- The ball is too close to the edge of the step. Need to shift the bouncing curve farther to the right.<br />
<br />
Shifting up and to the right:<br />
<br />
Sine wave:<br />
y = -(x-0.7) + 5 + sqrt(.1) + abs(sin(PI*-(x-0.7)))<br />
<br />
Circle:<br />
y = sqrt(0.1 - (x-t)^2) + (-(t-0.7) + 5 + sqrt(.1) + abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.7))))<br />
y = -sqrt(0.1 - (x-t)^2) + (-(t-0.7) + 5 + sqrt(.1) + abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.7))))<br />
<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=-floor(x)+5&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-(x-0.7)+5%20+%20sqrt(.1)+abs(sin(PI*-(x-0.7)))&v2=true&f3(x,t)=sqrt(0.1-(x-t)%5E2)+(-(t-0.7)+5+sqrt(.1)+abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.7))))&v3=true&f4(x,t)=-sqrt(0.1-(x-t)%5E2)+(-(t-0.7)+5+sqrt(.1)+abs(sin(PI*-(t-0.7))))&v4=true&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Looks perfect!<br />

I enjoy <a href="/p/draw-shapes.html">drawing shapes using math</a>. Much of the fun is exploring what formulas look like and figuring out how to warp them to look different.<br />
<br />
To be able to build more complex shapes and animations, in this post I'll explore some formulas and create a catalog of shapes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Circles:<br />
<br />
x^2 + y^2 = 1<br />
<br />
Graphtoy requires that we solve for y to create a function of x: f(x)<br />
<br />
y^2 = 1 - x^2<br />
y = ± sqrt(1 - x^2)<br />
f(x) = y = ± sqrt(1 - x^2)<br />
<br />
<br />
Graphtoy doesn't understand ± so we need to write two separate formulas:<br />
y = sqrt(1 - x^2)<br />
y = -sqrt(1 - x^2)<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=sqrt(1%20-%20x%5E2)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-sqrt(1%20-%20x%5E2)&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Here's what that looks like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/circle.jpg"><br />
<br />
In general, we can shift formulas up/down by adding/subtracting to/from the function. Here, we shift the circle up the y-axis by 2:<br />
y = sqrt(1 - x^2) + 2<br />
y = -sqrt(1 - x^2) + 2<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=sqrt(1-x%5E2)+2&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-sqrt(1-x%5E2)+2&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
And we can shift left/right similarly by adding/subtracting from every instance of "x". Here, we shift the circle left on the x-axis by 3:<br />
<br />
y = sqrt(1 - (x+3)^2)<br />
y = -sqrt(1 - (x+3)^2)<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=sqrt(1-(x+3)%5E2)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-sqrt(1-(x+3)%5E2)&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
We can combine these two techniques to shift left and up at the same time:<br />
<br />
y = sqrt(1 - (x+3)^2) + 2<br />
y = -sqrt(1 - (x+3)^2) + 2<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=sqrt(1-(x+3)%5E2)+2&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-sqrt(1-(x+3)%5E2)+2&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Lines:<br />
<br />
y = mx + b<br />
m is the slope (change in y divided by change in x)<br />
b is the y-intercept (notice that adding b is the same technique we used to shift the circle up)<br />
<br />
Here's a steep line that goes up 3 in the y direction for every increase of 1 in the x direction. I shifted it to intersect with the y-axis at y=1<br />
<br />
y = 3*x + 1<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=3*x%20+%201&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=false&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Here's what that looks like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/line.jpg"><br />
<br />
In general, we can flip the shape over the x-axis by making it negative (notice this is similar to the way we draw the bottom half of a circle, by flipping the formula to the top half):<br />
<br />
y = - (3*x + 1)<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=-(3*x+1)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=false&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Similarly, we can flip a shape over the y-axis by replacing every instance of "x" with "-x":<br />
<br />
y = 3*(-x) + 1<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=(3*(-x)+1)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=false&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Sine wave:<br />
<br />
y = sin(x)<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=sin(x)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=false&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Here's what that looks like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/sin.jpg"><br />
<br />
Something special about the shape of sin(x): it's periodic, repeating infinitely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Parabola:<br />
<br />
y = x^2<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=x%5E2&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=false&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Here's what that looks like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/parabola.jpg"><br />
<br />
If we want to turn a shape sideways (by swapping the axes), we can swap x and y.<br />
<br />
Sideways parabola:<br />
<br />
x = y^2<br />
<br />
Solve for y to be able to graph using Graphtoy:<br />
<br />
y = ± sqrt(x)<br />
<br />
y = sqrt(x)<br />
y = -sqrt(x)<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=sqrt(x)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-f1(x,t)&v2=true&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Combining shapes:<br />
<br />
We can combine formulas to combine their shapes. For example, we can make a sine wave follow the shape of a line by adding them together:<br />
<br />
Diagonal line:<br />
y = x + 3<br />
<br />
Sine wave:<br />
y = sin(3*x)<br />
<br />
Diagonal sine wave:<br />
y = x + 3 + sin(3*x)<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=x+3&v1=true&f2(x,t)=sin(3*x)&v2=true&f3(x,t)=x%20+%203%20+%20sin(3*x)&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Steps (floor):<br />
<br />
We can do some neat things using functions like floor and ceil. Floor rounds down to the nearest integer. Ceil rounds up to the nearest integer.<br />
<br />
y = floor(x)<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=floor(x)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=false&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
This looks like steps!<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/floor.jpg"><br />
<br />
We can make a spiky sawtooth wave by only giving y the decimal portion of x like this:<br />
y = x - floor(x)<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=x%20-%20floor(x)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=false&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
To get an intuitive understanding of a shape, sometimes it helps to write out some of the values in a table:<br />
<div id='code'> x     floor(x)     x-floor(x)<br />
=============================<br />
0        0            0<br />
0.2      0            0.2<br />
0.5      0            0.5<br />
1        1            0<br />
1.2      1            0.2<br />
1.5      1            0.5<br />
2        2            0<br />
2.2      2            0.2<br />
2.5      2            0.5</div>
This hopefully makes it easier to see how this ends up looking like a sawtooth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Triangle wave:<br />
<br />
<div id='code'>A sawtooth wave looks like this:         /|/|/|/|<br />
A flipped sawtooth wave looks like this: |\|\|\|\<br />
A triangle wave looks like this:         /\/\/\/\</div>
I noticed that I might be able to construct a triangle wave by combining a sawtooth wave with a flipped sawtooth wave.<br />
<br />
The naive approach of simply adding them together gives us this:<br />
Sawtooth wave:<br />
y = x - floor(x)<br />
Flipped (across the y-axis) sawtooth wave:<br />
y = -x - floor(-x)<br />
(Note: when writing this, I accidentally flipped the formula over the x-axis: y = -(x-floor(x)). When I graphed it, I realized my mistake and played around with the -s to get it right. It's normal to play around and make mistakes! Make some terms negative and see what happens to the shape!)<br />
<br />
Added together:<br />
y = x - floor(x) + -x - floor(-x)<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=x-floor(x)&v1=false&f2(x,t)=-x-floor(-x)&v2=false&f3(x,t)=x-floor(x)-x-floor(-x)&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Ah woops! That looks like a straight line. Graphing the sawtooth waves on top of each other reveals why: the diagonal portions cross each other, summing up to a constant value for most values of x.<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=x-floor(x)&v1=true&f2(x,t)=-x-floor(-x)&v2=true&f3(x,t)=x-floor(x)-x-floor(-x)&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
To get a triangle wave, I need to alternate taking a tooth from each sawtooth wave. I can take a tooth from one wave when floor(x) is even; a tooth from the other wave when floor(x) is odd.<br />
<br />
That sounds pretty crazy! Fortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">modular division</a> is an easy way to test whether a number is even or odd.<br />
<br />
<div id='code'>        floor(x) % 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also written as:<br />
x     mod(floor(x), 2)<br />
==============================<br />
1         1             (odd)<br />
1.9       1             (odd)<br />
2         0             (even)<br />
2.9       0             (even)<br />
3         1             (odd)<br />
4         0             (even)</div>
Our gadget to determine when floor(x) is odd: mod(floor(x), 2)<br />
We can use that to make a complementary gadget to determine when floor(x) is even: 1-mod(floor(x), 2)<br />
<br />
Sawtooth wave:<br />
y = x - floor(x)<br />
<br />
Flipped (across the y-axis) sawtooth wave:<br />
y = -x - floor(-x)<br />
<br />
Using our gadgets to zero out every other tooth:<br />
<br />
<div id='code'>    zero out even teeth                zero out odd teeth<br />
y = mod(floor(x), 2) * (x-floor(x)) + (1-mod(floor(x), 2)) * (-x-floor(-x)))</div>
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=x-floor(x)&v1=false&f2(x,t)=-x-floor(-x)&v2=false&f3(x,t)=mod(floor(x),2)*(x-floor(x))%20+%20(1-mod(floor(x),2))*(-x-floor(-x))&v3=true&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Here's what that looks like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/triangle-glitch.jpg"><br />
<br />
Notice that there are some visible glitches. Let's check the math:<br />
<br />
y = mod(floor(x), 2) * (x-floor(x)) + (1-mod(floor(x), 2)) * (-x-floor(-x)))<br />
<br />
Plug in x = 0:<br />
<br />
y = mod(floor(0), 2) * (0-floor(0)) + (1-mod(floor(0), 2)) * (-0-floor(-0)))<br />
y = 0 * (0-floor(0)) + (1-0) * (-0-floor(-0)))<br />
y = 0<br />
<br />
Ah but y is supposed to be 1. It looks like the equation has a bug.<br />
<br />
Checking a few more x, y values to build intuition:<br />
<div id='code'> x   y   y is supposed to be<br />
============================<br />
&nbsp;0   0          1<br />
&nbsp;1   0          0<br />
&nbsp;2   0          1<br />
&nbsp;3   0          0<br />
&nbsp;4   0          1</div>
In its current form, our formula is taking neither sawtooth's value when x is a perfect integer (looking at the formula, you can see that it's because (x-floor(x)) and (-x-floor(-x)) are always 0 when x is an integer.<br />
<br />
One fix is to add a term to our formula that has the value 1 for even integers and 0 otherwise.<br />
<br />
I played around and came up with this:<br />
(1-mod(floor(x),2))*(1-ceil(x-floor(x)))<br />
<br />
The first half of this is our even/odd gadget. The second half is an expression that is 1 for integers, 0 otherwise.<br />
<br />
Checking its values:<br />
<div id='code'>                                            (1-mod(floor(x),2)) *<br />
&nbsp;x   1-mod(floor(x),2)  1-ceil(x-floor(x))  (1-ceil(x-floor(x)))<br />
=================================================================<br />
0          1                   1                  1*1 = 1<br />
0.5        1                   0                  1*0 = 0<br />
1          0                   1                  0*1 = 0<br />
1.5        0                   0                  0*0 = 0<br />
2          1                   1                  1*1 = 1</div>
Fixed equation by adding this gadget:<br />
<br />
y = (mod(floor(x),2))*(x-floor(x))+(1-mod(floor(x),2))*(-x-floor(-x)) + (1-mod(floor(x),2))*(1-ceil(x-floor(x)))<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=(mod(floor(x),2))*(x-floor(x))+(1-mod(floor(x),2))*(-x-floor(-x))+(1-mod(floor(x),2))*(1-ceil(x-floor(x)))&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=false&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Here's what the fixed equation looks like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/triangle.jpg"><br />
<br />
Looks perfect! Our formula is pretty complex, though. It's possible we could come up with a simpler formula by reading this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_wave">Wikipedia page</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Square wave:<br />
<br />
Here's one way to make a square wave: take an already periodic formula and make it blocky.<br />
<br />
An easy periodic formula is sin(x).<br />
<br />
y = sin(x)<br />
<br />
Instead of having the period of sin be 2*PI, I can change it to be 2:<br />
<br />
y = sin(x*PI)<br />
<br />
I can use the "sign" function to turn positive values into 1 and negative values into -1:<br />
<br />
y = sign(sin(x*PI))<br />
<br />
If I want it to be truly square (1 tall and 1 wide), I'll need to adjust the height and shift it up:<br />
<br />
y = sign(sin(x*PI))/2 + 0.5<br />
<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html?f1(x,t)=sign(sin(x*PI))/2%20+%20.5&v1=true&f2(x,t)=&v2=false&f3(x,t)=&v3=false&f4(x,t)=&v4=false&f5(x,t)=&v5=false&f6(x,t)=&v6=false&grid=true&coords=0,0,12">Graphtoy link</a><br />
<br />
Here's what that looks like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/mathshapes/square.jpg"><br />
<br />
<br />
How did I come up with these formulas and techniques? I remember many of these from school and others I (re)discovered by playing around. You can expand your own catalog by trying out new formulas to see what they look like and taking <a href="/p/notes-txt.html">notes</a>!<br />

Computer graphics is a wonderful real-world use case for a lot of the math we learn in school. For example, take a look at <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org">Inigo Quilez</a>'s video <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org/live/index.htm">tutorials</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8--5LwHRhjk">This one</a> is particularly cool.<br />
<br />
I don't have skills like Inigo but I still have fun making 2D shapes using math.<br />
<br />
Here are a few fun tools for drawing 2D shapes using math:<br />
<br />
- <a href="/m/formulagraph/index.html">FormulaGraph</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- ** Added to this list in August 2021 **<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- After originally publishing this list, I built my own formula grapher by combining Relplot and Graphtoy (both mentioned below)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Features: interactive graphs, convenient UI, animate with time, available in any web browser, graph formulas (not just functions), graph polar formulas, graph inequalities<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- See the full details <a href="/p/formulagraph.html">here</a><br />
<br />
- TI calculators<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- You might have had one of these in high school<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- I had a TI-83 Plus which turned out to be a fun device. Here are some of its neat features:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- BASIC programming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Play games in MirageOS (back in my day the most popular game was <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/148/14876.html">Phoenix</a> and it looks like people kept <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/pub/83plus/asm/games/mirageos/">innovating</a> since then! They even made a version of <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/429/42952.html">Geometry Wars</a>!)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Share programs and games via a cable (they spread through the whole high school this way)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Graph interesting equations and shapes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There's a graphing mode which traces a function's shape with an animating circle. An upperclassman graphed some functions together which made it look like this circle was a <a href="/p/bouncing-ball.html">ball bouncing down stairs</a>. This stuck with me and is part of the inspiration for this post!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Looking back, I'm glad we got to play with these! Thank you, TI-83 Plus, for my earliest programming and engineering experiences!<br />
<br />
- Graphing calculator websites<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%3Dx%2C+y%3Dx%5E2">WolframAlpha</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Very powerful. For example: <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex">graphing x^y = y^x</a>, including symbolically refactoring the equation to solve for y.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="https://www.meta-calculator.com/?panel-101-equations&data-bounds-xMin=-507.6239316239339&data-bounds-xMax=1540.3760683760684&data-bounds-yMin=-1183.3191489361732&data-bounds-yMax=1632.6808510638268&data-equations-0=%22y%3Dx%22&data-equations-1=%22y%3Dx%5E2%22&data-rand=undefined&data-hideGrid=false">Meta-Calculator</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- OK in a pinch<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="http://fooplot.com">FooPlot</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="https://github.com/dheera/fooplot">Source code</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Fairly full-featured!<br />
<br />
- Graphing calculator apps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geogebra-graphing-calculator/id1146717204">GeoGebra Graphing Calculator</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This app is really good! Much like WolframAlpha and Relplot, this app can graph arbitrary equations and inequations like x^y = y^x, 1 = x^2 + y^2, y > x, etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/desmos-graphing-calculator/id653517540">Desmos Graphing Calculator</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This app might be even better. It also supports polar equations (e.g. r = cos(4*theta)).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Also available as a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">website</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/numworks-graphing-calculator/id1456585807">NumWorks Graphing Calculator</a> (simulates a physical calculator; hard to use)<br />
<br />
- <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/w8/~andru/relplot/">Relplot</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Powerful graphing capabilities: arbitrary equations and inequations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="https://github.com/andrewcmyers/relplot">Source code</a> (<a href="/m/relplot.tar.gz">my backup</a>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Relplot is written by one of my favorite CS professors, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/">Andrew Myers</a>!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- In fact, it's a more sophisticated version of a programming assignment we completed in his Functional Programming course<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Interesting implementation details:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Lexes and parses inputted formulas so they can be evaluated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="https://github.com/andrewcmyers/relplot/blob/master/eqn.grm">Slightly refactors</a> the formulas to be of the form "0 = formula" or "0 > formula":<br />
<div id='code'>Eqn   : Expr EQUALS Expr    (Plus(Expr1, neg(Expr2)))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Expr LT Expr        (Ltz(Plus(Expr1, neg(Expr2))))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Expr LE Expr        (Ltz(Plus(Expr1, neg(Expr2))))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Expr GE Expr        (Ltz(Plus(Expr2, neg(Expr1))))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Expr GT Expr        (Ltz(Plus(Expr2, neg(Expr1))))</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, converts "1 = x^2 + y^2" into "0 = x^2 + y^2 + -(1)"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In this form, all solutions to the formula are "zeros"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic">interval arithmetic</a> (implemented <a href="https://github.com/andrewcmyers/relplot/blob/master/interval.sml">here</a>) to identify subsections of the graph that contain x, y values for which the formula evaluates to zero<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Like a binary search, recursively searches smaller and smaller subsections of the graph for zeros until the interval size is too small to be visible. At this threshold, it can just draw a tiny line between the corners of the interval.<br />
<br />
- <a href="https://graphtoy.com/">Graphtoy</a> (<a href="/m/graphtoy/index.html">my backup</a>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- This is another cool piece of work by <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org">Inigo Quilez</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Something special: Graphtoy has a variable for elapsed time (t) which can be used to create animations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- <a href="/m/graphtoy/graphtoy.js">Source code</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Interesting implementation details:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Instead of implementing its own parser, Graphtoy turns the formulas into JavaScript snippets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- See the "iCompile" function which tweaks the inputted formula strings to be valid JavaScript and constructs Formula objects which can later be invoked<br />

I like listening to music. I like it even more when I discover connections between songs.<br />
<br />
It's cool to find out that a song is a cover of another song or that it contains samples of other songs.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://whosampled.com">WhoSampled.com</a> is a useful resource to find these connections. Rap songs in particular often contain a bunch of samples! Try searching for your favorites.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some of my favorite connections:<br />
<br />
