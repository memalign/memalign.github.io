Here's a collection of trippy art from various corners of the internet. Some is generated with the help of neural networks. Some is human-made.

[SectionTitle:AI-Generated Animations]
This technique may have started with [Link:http://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html]Deep Dream[/Link] from Google ([Link:https://github.com/google/deepdream]code[/Link]).

The gist of this technique: a neural network that's trained on images can be used to generate images. Iteratively generate images that are related to each other to create animations.

I'm taking artistic license in titling some of these examples. Many of these were generated using [Link:https://github.com/sportsracer48/pytti]pytti[/Link] by [Link:https://twitter.com/sportsracer48]@sportsracer48[/Link]. Some of the artists added music which you can hear in their tweets or if you view these mp4 files directly.

[SectionTitle:Zooming Art]
The art in this section is generally human-made without the use of neural networks. I'm only showing a still image for each entry here -- you need to visit each one to see its mesmerizing effect. I love that these perfectly loop back to the beginning.
