In an [Link:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38732804]HN post[/Link] about a very cool [Link:/p/puzzlescript.html]PuzzleScript[/Link] game called [Link:https://jacklance.github.io/PuzzleScript/play.html?p=cfdcc6e23f1fb3e9de2fd42fafaf4d4c]Enigmash[/Link], I learned sad news.

Jack Lance, the author of the game, died earlier this year.

I went to his website, [Link:https://jacklance.github.io]jacklance.github.io[/Link], and saw that it had been updated to refer to him in the past tense.

Seeing that the site is hosted on GitHub, I looked at the [Link:https://github.com/JackLance/jacklance.github.io/commit/92fc694347c53c7c87d8d5086aefde10a9a422de]recent updates[/Link]. I discovered two things:

- He made this update himself, to show up a few days later

- He published one last game, Octogram, but unfortunately made a typo in the URL to the game
  - Update 12/30/23: I [Link:https://github.com/JackLance/jacklance.github.io/commit/92fc694347c53c7c87d8d5086aefde10a9a422de#commitcomment-135624323]commented[/Link] on the git commit and one of Jack's siblings saw it. They pushed a fix and now the link on Jack's website is working!

Here's a working link to Jack Lance's last game: [Link:https://jacklance.github.io/octogram.html]Octogram[/Link].

It's a super tricky puzzle game with fun wordplay. Give the [Link:https://github.com/JackLance/jacklance.github.io/blob/master/octogram.html]source code[/Link] a peek if you get stuck -- but beware this will spoil all of the answers!

  - Due to some technical details of PuzzleScript, none of his PuzzleScript games are in this repo. Instead, they are stored as GitHub gists. I've grabbed a separate [Link:https://github.com/memalign/memalign.github.io/tree/master/m/octogram]backup[/Link] of every gist linked to by his games page for posterity.
- A YouTube [Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_xdEIPZ2Po]video[/Link] where Jonathan Blow mentions Jack's death. "...he was 25... he was already one of the best game designers in the world and was on track to be even better"
