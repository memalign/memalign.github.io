I still enjoy [Link:/p/similar-songs.html]finding songs that sound similar[/Link].

I recently listened to [Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQA59IkCF5I]Dear Prudence[/Link] by The Beatles and could've sworn I had heard the chord progression somewhere before. I searched online and found that I probably heard it in [Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAfyFTzZDMM]Beautiful[/Link] by Christina Aguilera. The website that gave me this connection is [Link:https://www.soundsjustlike.com/]SoundsJustLike.com[/Link].

SoundsJustLike.com is pretty cool with a long list of user-submitted song connections. Unfortunately, it's hard to search for a specific song. To make it easier, I created [Link:/m/similarsongs.html]this one-page snapshot[/Link] of all the songs users have submitted.

There are a lot of great songs on there to explore!
