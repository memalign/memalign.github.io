There's not enough time in the day for everything I want and need to do. Parenting, work, exercise, hobbies, sleep, etc.

I've found that even optimizing a few minutes here and there can add up to make life easier and more enjoyable. I still use tools for consuming [Link:/p/tts-download-into-brain.html]text[/Link] and [Link:/p/speed-up-av.html]audio/video[/Link] faster.

Here's one of the biggest new optimizations I was able to make this year.

I had a bunch of work time and a bunch of hobby time I wanted to spend in front of a keyboard. This is thoughtful writing or programming time that couldn't be stolen a few minutes at a time while waiting in line, walking between meetings, etc.

I also had a bunch of underutilized time on a stationary exercise bike. I mostly spent that time reading news feeds or watching TV/movies. I enjoyed that a lot, but it wasn't the right balance of time spent doing that when I had other things I wanted to prioritize.

I searched for a product that would let me use a laptop or iPad + keyboard case while exercising on the stationary bike.

I came across [Link:https://airdesks.com]airdesks.com[/Link] and bought their [Link:https://airdesks.com/products/laptop/laptop-desk/]laptop desk[/Link]. I got the 64" tall, "Average Size Laptop", No AirShelves config. It's been awesome. I use it on the bike every day and occasionally as a standing desk.

Right now, I'm writing this post while exercising on the bike while my son is napping -- something I couldn't have squeezed in without this desk!
