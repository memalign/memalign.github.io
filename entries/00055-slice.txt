Introducing my latest project, playable right in your web browser: [Link:/m/slice/index.html]Slice Tap Toy[/Link]

Slice Tap Toy can also be saved to your home screen as a PWA (Progressive Web App).

This project is my spin on the touch screen swipe-to-slice concept. Every pizza can be sliced multiple times, down to tiny slivers. Can you unlock the whole menu?

Swiping across a touch screen to slice objects is a delightful and fun mechanic. You might remember some of the best early games for iPhone: Fruit Ninja and Cut The Rope.

Unfortunately, these formerly wonderful games are no longer delightful, now with constant interruptions and ads. Go try them and see for yourself. These games have been ruined.

Slice Tap Toy is a simple passion project so it can be light, fun, and pristine.

Development details:

I was inspired to make Slice Tap Toy when I came across [Link:https://js13kgames.com/entries/samurai-sam]Samurai Sam[/Link], an entry to the 2023 JS13KGames competition. This got me thinking about slicing games.

I decided to do some quick prototyping by hacking on [Link:/m/taptoy/index.html]Tap Toy[/Link]'s source code. I vetted that I could track slices from touch and mouse input, draw the slices, and detect collisions without much work. Like the original Tap Toy, I use [Link:/m/pceimage/index.html]PCEImage[/Link] for the art.

Like [Link:/m/cr/index.html]CaveRibbon[/Link] ([Link:/p/caveribbon.html]project details[/Link]), I used LLMs to help. I could do some things faster, I was able to get the website to look how I wanted without becoming an expert on CSS, and (new to this project) I was able to get artistic inspiration for the art. I asked DALL-E to generate pizza pixel art. What I got were grotesque abominations that, to this day, have eroded some of my enjoyment of pizza. I stared at flesh colored cheese and glitchy toppings and turned them into my own cleaner pixel art pizzas. I'll spare you the examples.
