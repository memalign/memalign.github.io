I know some people who are always reading a book. I’m not an avid book reader like them.

I enjoy reading, though. When reading, I get attached to the characters and the plot. When I finish a book, I feel melancholy, a mild mourning for my fictional companions.
I try to pick books that will be fun to read while also sticking with me for years to come.
In some ways, I treat TV, movies, and books similarly: I don’t always need to be consuming something and I try to pick meaningful ones. I like to think about what I watched/read for weeks or months before picking up something else.

Here’s a list of some books I’ve read. I’ll try to update this periodically.



Non-Fiction:

- After Steve

- The Art of Leadership: Small Things Done Well

- Becoming Steve Jobs

- Black Like Me

- The Checklist Manifesto

- Creative Selection

- Extreme Ownership
    - The lessons in this book directly apply to engineering management and leadership. I highly recommend it.

- Getting to Yes

- The Hard Thing About Hard Things

- How to Win Friends and Influence People
    - Useful lessons include: show sincere appreciation for people, take authentic interest, understand their perspective, admit when you're wrong
    - The bad: racist and sexist commentary and advice; a passive aggressive approach to giving feedback. For feedback, I much prefer the advice in Radical Candor. I find that's a more authentic and less manipulative way to interact with others.

- Punished by Rewards

- Radical Candor
    - This is another great book for leaders and managers.

- Steve Jobs

- Thinking Fast and Slow



Fiction:

- The Alchemist

- '--All You Zombies--'

- American Gods

- Atlas Shrugged

- The Bicentennial Man

- Brave New World

- Breakfast of Champions

- Cat’s Cradle
    - I like Vonnegut’s writing for its humor, depth, and straightforwardness. He’s one of the few authors with more than one book on my list.

- The Catcher in the Rye

- Choke

- Death of a Salesman

- Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency

- Dune
    - The writing is dense and not usually what I would choose to read. I’m still glad I read it because it’s one of the classics which gets a lot of references.

    - Wonderful short story by Andy Weir

- Ender’s Game
    - One of my favorite books. It’s an interesting story which also influences my own thoughts about leadership in the real world.

- Ender’s Shadow
    - A sort-of-sequel to Ender’s Game. I enjoyed how it layers extra depth onto a story I already loved.

- Fahrenheit 451

- Fight Club

- Foundation trilogy
    - Foundation
    - Foundation and Empire
    - Second Foundation

    - Asimov is another author with many books on my list. I think about these stories a lot today (in the year 2020) when things feel out of control.

- Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series
    - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
    - The Girl Who Played with Fire
    - The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest

- The Gods Themselves

- Good Omens

- The Graduate

- The Great Gatsby

- Harry Potter series
    - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone
    - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
    - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
    - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
    - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
    - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
    - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

    - A series core to my childhood and young adulthood. I got the first book as a present from my grandmother for graduating 5th grade.

- Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy trilogy
    - The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy
    - The Restaurant at the End of the Universe
    - Life, the Universe and Everything
    - So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
    - Mostly Harmless
    - Young Zaphod Plays it Safe
    - And Another Thing...

    - Funny and light while still carrying depth. Some of my favorites.

- Hyperion
    - Interesting stories though I wish I had known up-front that there would be no ending to tie off loose ends and plot-lines.

- The Illustrated Man

- John Dies at the End series
    - John Dies at the End
    - This Book is Full of Spiders
    - What the Hell Did I Just Read
    - If This Book Exists, You're in the Wrong Universe

    - Fun comedy horror from Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), another author with several books on my list.

    - Wonderful short story by Isaac Asimov

- Learning to Be Me
    - Unsettling and thought-provoking short story by Greg Egan. It could be a Black Mirror episode.

- The Little Prince

- Lord of the Flies

- Lord of the Rings
    - The Hobbit
    - The Fellowship of the Ring
    - The Two Towers
    - The Return of the King

    - Dense fantasy classics. I’m glad I’ve read them but I don’t love them. I tried to read the Silmarillion but that was way too far in the wrong direction for me (even more dense and way less story).

- The Perks of Being a Wallflower
    - Really resonated with my angsty teenager self

- Permutation City

- The Red Pony

- Replay
    - One of my favorite books: fun, fast, thought-provoking

- Slaughterhouse-Five

- Snow Crash

- The Terminal Experiment

- Watchmen

- Watership Down

- Zoey Ashe series
    - Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits
    - Zoey Punches the Future in the Dick
