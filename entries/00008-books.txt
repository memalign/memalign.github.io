I know some people who are always reading a book. I’m not an avid book reader like them.

I enjoy reading, though. When reading, I get attached to the characters and the plot. When I finish a book, I feel melancholy, a mild mourning for my fictional companions.

I try to pick books that will be fun to read while also sticking with me for years to come.

In some ways, I treat TV, movies, and books similarly: I don’t always need to be consuming something and I try to pick meaningful ones. I like to think about what I watched/read for weeks or months before picking up something else.

Here’s a list of some books and short stories I’ve read. I’ll try to update this periodically.



Non-Fiction:

- After Steve by Tripp Mickle

- The Art of Leadership: Small Things Done Well by Michael Lopp

- Becoming Steve Jobs by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli

- Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin

- The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande

- Creative Selection by Ken Kocienda

    - The lessons in this book directly apply to engineering management and leadership. I highly recommend it.

- Getting to Yes by Roger Fisher and William Ury

- The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz

- How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie
    - Useful lessons include: show sincere appreciation for people, take authentic interest, understand their perspective, admit when you're wrong
    - The bad: racist and sexist commentary and advice; a passive aggressive approach to giving feedback. For feedback, I much prefer the advice in Radical Candor. I find that's a more authentic and less manipulative way to interact with others.

- Make Something Wonderful by the Steve Jobs Archive

- Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn

- Radical Candor by Kim Scott
    - This is another great book for leaders and managers.
