I've always had a hard time [Link:/p/emoji-conway.html]falling asleep[/Link]. Closing my eyes invites a whirlwind of thoughts. I can't stop thinking so I can't fall asleep.

Then I found a way to clear my head and fall asleep quickly. It's been working for months now!

Here's what I do:

As I shower and brush my teeth before bed, I spend that ~30 minutes clearing my head. When I notice a thought, I think "ah" and let the thought go, let it dissipate and fade. This isn't the time for thinking and problem solving, it's the time to empty my mind so I can fall asleep.

I repeat this for every thought that creeps in. I've found it also helps to focus on my immediate senses to keep my head emptier: the sound of the toothbrush, the soap/water/friction on my hands. I'm grounded in the present. I'm not thinking about these sounds and feelings; I'm just experiencing them without commentary.

Sometimes this helps me notice a feeling of muscle tightness. Maybe I'm furrowing my brow or frowning. Maybe I have tightness in my shoulders. I release the tension and physically relax.

I continue this meditation as I slide into bed until I fall asleep. And I continue it if I wake up in the middle of the night.

I don't know if this technique is real "meditation" in the Zen Buddhism sense but I was inspired to try it after, months ago, stumbling upon [Link:https://nkanaev.com/zen101/en/]101 Zen Stories[/Link] ([Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101_Zen_Stories]Wikipedia[/Link]). (Warning: these are old and may contain antiquated or even racist terms)

I don't understand them even though they are simple. I tried to search for answers about one of the more famous stories: [Link:https://nkanaev.com/zen101/en/021/]The Sound of One Hand[/Link] ([Link:/m/sound-of-one-hand.html]mirror[/Link]).

I found a [Link:https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-behind-What-is-the-sound-of-one-hand-clapping]Quora thread[/Link] with some discussion. No answer was perfectly satisfying but two similar posts stood out:

Khiêm Bảo Thiện:
[Quote]However, when one asks you about one hand clapping - which is extraordinary, uncommon, unseen, not understandable - your mind starts to set on a quest for answer, which raises a lot of noises, like you throw a big rock into a tranquil lake. ... So, using this koan and similar, for certain situations, helps the learner realize his/her mind's activities.[/Quote]

[Quote]The idea behind this phrase is not literal, but is meant to "blend" your mind Matrix-style and hopefully trick you into observing your mind as it kinda freaks out.[/Quote]

Is the key to enlightenment learning to notice your thoughts and then clear your head? Who knows. I certainly feel lighter when my head is clear, my muscles are relaxed, and I float off to sleep.
