  It now also is one of the site's own "picks".</p>

  published an in-depth review of Space Trader, giving it 
  5 out of 5 stars and naming as the only Con that the game is "addictive".</p>
<p><a href="http://pda.tucows.com/palm/preview/134818.html" target="_top">TuCows</a> gave the game <img src="http://pda.tucows.com/images/4ratelg.gif" alt="4 cows">... 
  They reviewed version 1.0 of Space Trader (the one without pictures and a lot 
  less features) and I scored 29 points, needing 30 points for a "5 cows" rating. Maybe they could re-review the latest version?</p>
<p>Rutger Boot of the <a href="http://palmclub.nl/reviews/software/games/spacetrader/" target="_top">Nederlandse Palmclub</a>

  Space Trader was awarded <img src="http://www.rocketdownload.com/images/5emotsh.gif" alt="5 rockets"> and called "exceptionally sophisticated". I'm blushing.</p>

  PDA Street</a> picked Space Trader as one of the top 5 free games. A good accomplishment, though not
  <i>that</i> impressive if you notice that one of the other games in the top 5 is SexyPoker...</p>
