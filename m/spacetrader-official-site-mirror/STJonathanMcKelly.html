Hello.

<p>My name is Jonathan McKelly. I was born in a distant solar system so 
long ago that I forgot its name. That was almost 300 days ago!

<p>As a small boy I heard the story about the Utopian Moon. That's where I am 
today. Writing my story.

<p>I started as a small trader. But robots were my fascination. I didn't 
have much money. So I would take a loan and buy one single robot and 
then resell it a few parsecs away. I love robots. My best trade was 20 
brand new robots bought at a price of about 3800 cr. and sold at about the
double! That's 77,000 cr. of profit in a single trip! I was piloting a
Hornet, worth about 220,000 cr. With a Lightning shield and equipped with 
3 military lasers.

<p>When I encountered an offer to buy a Moon for the first time, I was about 
400,000 cr. short. :)
I wanted it so hard that I was ready to sell my precious ship just to 
acquire my own moon. But without a safe ride, it wasn't possible to get 
to it. So I started working hard, and soon I had about 550.000 cr. in 
cash! And I bought it!

<p>But the Devil has his ways. On my journey to Utopia, I met a captain 
asking me to revenge his stolen ship. Hushing my conscience with 
collegiality, I just wanted to be a big guy. So I replaced my two 
military lasers with two pulse ones and start chasing that bastard. 
And I found him. And I almost got killed. I lost my ship ending in some 
pre-industrial system, with a bare Flea, with a lot of money, but no 
ships to buy, no shields to acquire and lots of pirates orbitting.

<p>I guess I was lucky after all. Somehow I reached my Utopia and 
climbed this rock orbitting around the tranquil planet.

<p>Thank you for creating my Universe!
