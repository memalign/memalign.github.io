<p> Space Trader Version: 1.2.2<br>
  Palm OS: 2.0 and higher (at least 3.5 needed for color or grayscales)<br>
  Size: 393K (color), 337K (gray), 284K (b&w).</p>
<p> Version 1.2.2 is upwards compatible with all previous versions. You can upgrade 
  without losing your current game.</p>
<p>There are three versions of Space Trader available in the download file: a color 
  version, a grayscales version and a black &amp; white version. Make sure you install
  the right version for your Palm. The black & white version works always, but, of course,
  doesn't look as good as the other versions.</p>

<p>If you are in the lucky possession of a Palm that can download applications directly from
  the web, here are direct links to the PRC files of the <a href="SpaceTrader_color.prc">color</a>, 
  <a href="SpaceTrader_gray.prc">grayscales</a> and

<p>The previous version of Space Trader is still online. This is in case the current release hasn't been beta-tested enough, or if people want to compare the two versions. You'll find version 1.2.1 <a href="SpaceTrader121.zip">here</a>, and the source code of 1.2.1 <a href="SpaceTraderSource121.zip">here</a>.

<h2>New in version 1.2.2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Jim Anderson sent me a fix for the absent
  Scarab problem.</li>
<li>The newspapers will now announce the
  coming of all heroes, not only of those
  that are exactly at the minimum hero score.</li>
<li>If, by any chance, after transporting Wild 
  you are not a criminal, your police record
  will no longer be reset to clean.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New in version 1.2.1</h2>

<ul>
<li>DrWowe sent me the fix for the "Special" bug,
  which makes newer Palm versions crash when you
  tap the "Special" button. It should be fixed now.
  Note that this was a "pointer" error, which in
  programmer terms means that it could have any
  weird effect. Now, there were some rare errors
  reported that I have not been able to solve,
  nor been able to replicate. It may very well
  be that this pointer error was responsible for
  those problems too.</li>
<li>Solved a very irritating problem that could
  happen if you installed a version of SpaceTrader
  which was incompatible with your Palm; it could
  happen that your Palm would lock up even if
  you didn't try to start the game.</li>
<li>Solved a rare glitch where you could get negative 
  cargo bays.</li>
<li>Solved a problem where donating a shield or
  weapon to a famous captain would bodge your
  remaining shields or weapons, if it wasn't the
  last shield/weapon in row that was removed.</li>
</ul>
