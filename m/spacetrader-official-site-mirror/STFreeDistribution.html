<h1>Free Distribution?</h1>
    
<p>Whenever I release a new version of Space Trader, I upload the latest release 
to several big distribution sites. Within a few weeks, this new
version will have spread to almost all other distribution sites.</p>
    
<p>When version 1.2.0 of Space Trader was released, I wanted to go through the same motions. 
However, I noticed a lot of things had changed since I last did this in January 
2002. Many sites have installed a system where you can pay to have your product 
get boons like being listed under "new updates", getting reviewed, or (god forbid) 
appear on "recommended" lists. Yes, popularity of these distribution sites 
has soared, and by golly, some people are going to make lots of money from 
it!</p>
    
<p>The whole "pay to get your product a better placement among the other 
products" is a bit fishy in itself. You cannot trust recommendations on a 
site that offers software developers these possibilities. A site that has 
installed such a scheme has thrown honesty overboard to erect an altar for 
Mammon. Of course, that's what advertising is all about, and as long as site 
visitors realize that (which, sadly, they often don't) I can live with that.</p>
    
<p>But it gets worse.</p>
    
<p>When I was trying to update my listing on ZDNet/CNet (merged in Upload.com), 
after uploading the new version of the software and filling out a (long) list
of update specifications, I was confronted with a screen that asked how I
wanted to have them support my "product". I could buy all kinds of nice services
from them for serious amounts of dough. Of course, I scrolled down to the
bottom of the page where I expected to find the choice "No special treatment
of my software, free of charge." It wasn't there. Instead, I found it said
"No special treatment of my software, $49."</p>
    
<p>Forty-nine dollars.</p>
    
<p>I was annoyed.</p>
    
<p>Of course, since Space Trader is a free game, I am not going to pay for 
it to appear on some site. So I didn't choose any of these options (there 
was no choice "WHAT? You want my money? Well then, **** it!"), but just left 
their site in disgust.</p>
    
<p>Personally, I find this "payment required" policy very strange. Distribution 
sites live by completeness, which they can only achieve by enlisting the support
of software developers. <i>I</i> am willing to take the trouble to supply
<i>them</i> with the latest version of my free software. If they want me
to pay for that privilige, they can just forget it.</p>
     
<p><a href="http://www.palmgear.com" target="_top">PalmGear</a>
  still rules: free and immediate access to my own software listings. PalmGear 
does make money from software listings. PalmGear receives provisions on sales
through their site. That's how it should be.</p>
    
<p>But the story goes on. Evidently, Upload.com keeps track of updates that 
have not been completed. After a few days, I received the following email.</p>

  </blockquote>
  
<p>I personally had a good laugh at "We look forward to helping you."</p>
  
<p>Did you notice the "range of promotional placements in key areas"? What do you expect to find in those "key areas": the best software or the products of companies that pay the most? Did you also notice that suddenly "MSN Downloads" has something to do with this? Whenever I encounter a situation where money gets the upper hand over quality, I am not surprised to see the name of Microsoft there.</p>

<p>Anyway, I decided to respond to this message. Not that I expect them to take it seriously, but it's the only thing I can do directly to let my voice be heard. I told them the following.
  
<blockquote>
   <small><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">
<p>When I first submitted my "product"  to ZDNet and CNet, this was a free
service.</p>
<p>The (quite popular) Palm game "Space Trader" I uploaded was and
is freeware. I am NOT going to pay for the privilige of providing YOU with
the latest version of my software. So you can choose between three alternatives:</p>
<p><ol><li>You stick with the old version of my software for your download service,
which means you provide a disservice for your users. Frankly, I think a site
that provides software that is out-of-date can not be taken seriously, so
I recommend you do NOT go with this option. Palm OS 5.0 users will be very
disappointed if they download the version you now supply.</li>
<li>You remove
my software entirely from your download service, which ALSO means you provide
a disservice for your users. I won't be the only one taking this stand, and
so your site will quickly lose its attractiveness as a download centre, because
it will be very incomplete. People who are looking for freeware will go somewhere
else (PalmGear, for instance). Obviously, this will have an impact on the
number of sales commercial developers have through your site.</li>
<li>You put
the latest version of my software on your download service for free. I am
not making any money from it (in fact, it costs me a lot of time and money
to keep it updated), and I do not intend to shell out a sizeable sum for
distribution. Asking commercial software developers for a contribution to
use your service is acceptable, but to ask money from someone who provides 
a free service is ludicrous.</li>
</ol></p>   
<p>I hope you decide wisely.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Pieter Spronck.<br>
Author of "Space Trader".</p>
</font></small></blockquote>

<p>I will continue this story if I get a reaction.</p>

<p>Now, if you wonder what <i>you</i> can do: I'd say that first and foremost you should realize what faulty service some distribution sites provide. Seek out the ones you know are OK. Now and again you can write them a message saying something like "I saw you had release <i>x.x</i> of software package <i>y</i> on your site. Don't you know release <i>z.z</i> is available nowadays? Please distribute the latest version from your otherwise excellent site!"</p>

<p>Maybe, in time, someone will listen.</p>

<p>December 12, 2002.</p>

<p>An alert player just informed me that CNet and ZDNet are now distributing version 1.2.0 of
Space Trader (three months after its release and after I uploaded it). 
They didn't inform me about this, but I assume they have seen the error of their
ways and I will try to upload the next version to them also. I am guessing I will encounter
the "incentive" to pay them again, but I will, of course, ignore it once more.</p>
