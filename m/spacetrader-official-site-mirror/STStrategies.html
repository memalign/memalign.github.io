<h1>Strategies</h1>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Warning!</font></b> This section contains <b>spoilers</b>.</p>
<p>Here, I will reveal some of the strategies I use while playing Space Trader. 
  If players send their own strategies to me, I might also add those.</p>
<h2>Starting out</h2>
<p>When starting out as a brand-new space trader, your main goal is to stay alive, 
  and your second goal is to make a profit. Staying alive means that you should 
  never fight. That means that you should avoid fights if you can, and flee if 
  you get attacked. A high piloting skill helps, so my personal choice is to put 
  a lot of skill points in the piloting skill, at least 8, and often 10. Piloting 
  is important for every type of play, so these points are never wasted. To avoid 
  fights, simply don't visit systems where there are &quot;many&quot; pirates 
  or even more than that. If you must visit such a system, because it is the only 
  way to get to a place where you need to go, simply go there with empty cargo 
  holds, except for one canister of water. When pirates attack you, simply surrender 
  and let them have the cargo. They will be satisfied and you won't be attacked 
  again. When you get the cash, upgrade to a ship which has a shield slot and 
  install a shield. From that moment, you may try to visit systems which are a 
  bit more dangerous, because you have some buffer when you get attacked.</p>
<p>To get rich quick, a high trader skill helps but isn't really necessary. Not 
  being a criminal (thereby losing 10% of your trading profits) is also a good 
  thing, but still not necessary. The standard way to earn good money is to pick 
  up water, furs, food and ore on pre-agricultural or agricultural systems, and 
  bring those to a post-industrial or hi-tech system, and ferry some tech goods 
  back. In small systems prices are higher than in large systems, so you best 
  buy at a large system and ship to a small system. Even better is to make use 
  of the special resources which some systems have. While food is a great buy 
  at an agricultural system, it is a lot cheaper when that system has rich soil. 
  Technologically advanced systems pay good money for food, but they pay even 
  better for it if they have poor soil themselves. Furthermore, most government 
  types have some type of goods they especially like. For instance, democracies 
  are populated by free people who like to play games, so games will bring you 
  an extra good price. However, best of all is to make use of special events which 
  occur in a solar system. If there is a crop failure somewhere, ship them food. 
  If people are bored, bring them games or narcotics (if you dare). If there is 
  a lack of workers, ship in machines or robots. In one of my games, I was lucky 
  to find an tiny industrial democracy next to a huge hi-tech cybernetic state. 
  There was a lack of workers in the democracy, so I started shipping in robots. 
  I made a profit of more than 
  3000 credits on each canister of robots I shipped. I was lucky that the event 
  lasted a couple of turns, and could trade in my Gnat for nothing less than a 
  Grasshopper after about five shipments. And since robots are legal goods, I 
  even didn't have to worry about the police. Of course, this was a lucky find, 
  but there are many such opportunities in the galaxy, not all with such huge 
  profits, but there is good money to be made.</p>
<p>Something which most people find difficult is to get the money to buy enough 
  even to fill the cargo bays of a Gnat. There are several ways around that. First 
  of all, there is a bank, which will loan even a starting space trader 1000 credits, 
  doubling your cash balance. It's best to pay them back as soon as you don't 
  need it anymore, because you have to pay interest (note that interest is detracted from
  your cash balance as soon as you warp, and is <i>not</i> added to your debt, unless
  you don't have enough cash), but it's better to get a 
  loan than to fly with empty bays. Another way to get money at the start of the 
  game is simply to sell your pulse laser. This gives you 1500 credits extra, 
  and you don't need it if you don't intend to fight. So, instead of the 1000 
  credits which most poor traders start with, you have 3500 credits to play with 
  (4500 if you play Beginner or Easy level). Bill Andel suggested selling your
  Gnat for a Flea at the start of the game. This gives you a lot of money to 
  play with, but you are, of course, restricted to only 10 cargo bays. However, according
  to Bill, this allowed him to get a Firefly much quicker.</p>
<p>A good buy after the first few days is 5 extra cargo bays. This will allow 
  you to carry even more goods, and they are cheap, so you will earn them back 
  quickly. Just make sure you keep enough cash to buy goods when you invest into 
  cargo bays.</p>
<h2>Middle game</h2>
After a while you will have enough money to buy a new ship. Which ship do you 
need to buy? Well, that depends on your style of gameplay. Personally, I like 
the Firefly, Bumblebee and Grasshopper the best, but that's because I like to 
become a trader/bounty hunter later in the game. If you are a die-hard trader, 
the Beetle and the Termite are great ships for you, while if you like to be a 
pirate, the Mosquito, Hornet and Wasp should be your choices.  Matthew Allen suggested a
Mosquito with two beam lasers, an energy shield and an autorepair system as
a fairly cheap ship that handles itself pretty well in combat even against
Grasshoppers. 
<p>Upgrading your 
ship is a good idea. You might think it is best to hoard your cash until you can 
jump from a Gnat to a Grasshopper in one go, but going towards your ideal ship 
with a few intermediary steps is a good idea. First of all, you usually get more 
cargo bays which allow you to become a more successful trader. Secondly, you can 
get extra crew quarters, allowing you to hire mercenaries. If you have a trader 
skill of 1, try to get a mercenary who is a good trader, and see your profits 
soar. And finally, be aware that if you become richer, the pirates get stronger 
and more numerous. While you are still flying a Gnat and hoarding a capital, they 
will have upgraded and will attack you with all the more power, possibly quickly 
ending the game for you. 
<p>Use the average price list to determine where good deals can be made. According
to Andrew Wilkin, if you don't know where you should travel to buy cheap goods, look at
the price of firearms. According to him, cheap firearms are a good indication of a system where many
cheap goods are available. I myself cannot confirm this observation, but since the
determination of selling prices is a complex matter, it is certainly possible that he is right.
<p>When should you take the risk of trafficking illegal goods (firearms and narcotics)? 
  You can do that at any time in the game, but best is to wait until you are at 
  least &quot;lawful&quot;. At that point, police won't check on you as often. 
  If they still do, bribe them or flee. Fleeing will revert your police record 
  to dubious, but that still isn't criminal. You will get more inspections, so 
  you should lay low for a few days, until they trust you again. Usually, trafficking 
  is a good thing where profits are concerned. Especially narcotics can bring 
  insane profits if you buy them cheap (at a hi-tech system) and sell them at 
  a very low-tech system. Even pre-agricultural systems will buy narcotics and 
  will pay a lot for them. And if they are a theocracy, all the better.</p>
<p>Concerning equipment, it's best to first fill all your slots before you upgrade 
  to better equipment. Two pulse lasers are better than one beam laser, and a 
  pulse laser and a beam laser together are better than one military laser. The 
  same goes for shields: you better have two energy shields than one reflective 
  shield. Of course, you should decide whether you will invest in better equipment 
  or wait until you have a better ship. Personally, I like to fill all my slots 
  with the weakest lasers and shields and buy extra cargo bays for all my gadget 
  slots, and wait until I have bought at least a Grasshopper before I start buying 
  better shields and lasers. I can't say if that is the best tactic, though. You 
  should know that you will certainly encounter pirate Gnats who carry military 
  lasers (although not that many).</p>
<p>If you want to go pirating, you must have a good piloting, fighting and engineering 
  skill. That means that you need at least one mercenary, and probably two, to 
  compensate for the lack of your own skills. A navigating or targeting system 
  also helps. If the police gives you too much trouble, get a cloaking device. 
  For a trader, a cloaking device is an absolute must. Remember that the success 
  of a cloaking device depends on your engineering skills, so you should rate 
  high in those.</p>
<p>While in the middle game, you are so far advanced that you don't want to lose 
  everything you have built up. That means that you simply shouldn't fight to 
  the death. Be prepared to give up your cargo to a pirate if you are in a losing 
  fight. Yes, it hurts, but it's better than being killed, or having to eject 
  your escape pod. Of course, when you are a psycho and the police is attacking 
  you, you might not have the option to surrender. But such is life on the road 
  to hell.</p>
<h2>Nearing the end</h2>
<p>When you are flying a Wasp or Termite with all military lasers, reflective 
  shields, a couple of nice gadgets and some supporting mercenaries, the endgame 
  has started. If you held out so long, congratulations. Still, it's not the time 
  to let your guard down, because even a Mosquito can kill a Wasp if the Wasp 
  is weakened by earlier fights. The richer you are, the better equipped your 
  opponents will be. </p>
<p>If you want to end the game the way it should be ended, you should seek out 
  someone who is willing to sell you a moon. There are several solar systems where 
  a moon is sold, but you will only get that offer if you are worth at least 400,000 
  credits. So the offer might be in a system which you visited before. Just start 
  coasting through the galaxy, carrying half-a-million credits in cash, until 
  you get the offer. It is not wise to sell your Wasp for a Gnat, thereby creating 
  the money you need to buy the moon, because the costs of the moon are part of 
  your worth, and since you still have to traverse part of the galaxy to claim 
  your moon, you will need your ship to fight off all the strong pirates you'll 
  meet underway.</p>
<p>Claiming your moon ends the game. Congratulations. Now it's time for a harder 
  level. </p>
