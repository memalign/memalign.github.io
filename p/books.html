I know some people who are always reading a book. I’m not an avid book reader like them.<br />
<br />
I enjoy reading, though. When reading, I get attached to the characters and the plot. When I finish a book, I feel melancholy, a mild mourning for my fictional companions.<br />
I try to pick books that will be fun to read while also sticking with me for years to come.<br />
In some ways, I treat TV, movies, and books similarly: I don’t always need to be consuming something and I try to pick meaningful ones. I like to think about what I watched/read for weeks or months before picking up something else.<br />
<br />
Here’s a list of some books I’ve read. I’ll try to update this periodically.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Non-Fiction:<br />
<br />
- Becoming Steve Jobs<br />
<br />
- Black Like Me<br />
<br />
- The Checklist Manifesto<br />
<br />
- Creative Selection<br />
<br />
- Extreme Ownership<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The lessons in this book directly apply to engineering management and leadership. I highly recommend it.<br />
<br />
- Getting to Yes<br />
<br />
- The Hard Thing About Hard Things<br />
<br />
- Punished by Rewards<br />
<br />
- Radical Candor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This is another great book for leaders and managers.<br />
<br />
- Steve Jobs<br />
<br />
- Thinking Fast and Slow<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fiction:<br />
<br />
- American Gods<br />
<br />
- Atlas Shrugged<br />
<br />
- The Bicentennial Man<br />
<br />
- Brave New World<br />
<br />
- Breakfast of Champions<br />
<br />
- Cat’s Cradle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I like Vonnegut’s writing for its humor, depth, and straightforwardness. He’s one of the few authors with more than one book on my list.<br />
<br />
- The Catcher in the Rye<br />
<br />
- Choke<br />
<br />
- Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency<br />
<br />
- Dune<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The writing is dense and not usually what I would choose to read. I’m still glad I read it because it’s one of the classics which gets a lot of references.<br />
<br />
- <a href="http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html">The Egg</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wonderful short story by Andy Weir<br />
<br />
- Ender’s Game<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- One of my favorite books. It’s an interesting story which also influences my own thoughts about leadership in the real world.<br />
<br />
- Ender’s Shadow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A sort-of-sequel to Ender’s Game. I enjoyed how it layers extra depth onto a story I already loved.<br />
<br />
- Fight Club<br />
<br />
- Foundation trilogy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Foundation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Foundation and Empire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Second Foundation<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Asimov is another author with many books on my list. I think about these stories a lot today (in the year 2020) when things feel out of control.<br />
<br />
- Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Girl Who Played with Fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest<br />
<br />

<br />
- Good Omens<br />
<br />
- Harry Potter series<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A series core to my childhood and young adulthood. I got the first book as a present from my grandmother for graduating 5th grade.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
- Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy trilogy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Restaurant at the End of the Universe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Life, the Universe and Everything<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mostly Harmless<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Young Zaphod Plays it Safe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- And Another Thing...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Funny and light while still carrying depth. Some of my favorites.<br />
<br />
- Hyperion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Interesting stories though I wish I had known up-front that there would be no ending to tie off loose ends and plot-lines.<br />
<br />
- The Illustrated Man<br />
<br />
- John Dies at the End series<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- John Dies at the End<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This Book is Full of Spiders<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- What the Hell Did I Just Read<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Fun comedy horror from Jason Parkin (aka David Wong), another author with several books on my list.<br />
<br />
- <a href="https://www.multivax.com/last_question.html">The Last Question</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wonderful short story by Isaac Asimov<br />
<br />
- Learning to Be Me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Unsettling and thought-provoking short story by Greg Egan. It could be a Black Mirror episode.<br />
<br />
- The Little Prince<br />
<br />
- Lord of the Flies<br />
<br />
- Lord of the Rings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Hobbit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Fellowship of the Ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Two Towers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Return of the King<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Dense fantasy classics. I’m glad I’ve read them but I don’t love them. I tried to read the Silmarillion but that was way too far in the wrong direction for me (even more dense and way less story).<br />
<br />
- The Perks of Being a Wallflower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Really resonated with my angsty teenager self<br />
<br />
- The Red Pony<br />
<br />
- Replay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- One of my favorite books: fun, fast, thought-provoking<br />
<br />
- Slaughterhouse-Five<br />
<br />
- Snow Crash<br />
<br />
- The Terminal Experiment <br />
<br />
- Watchmen<br />
<br />
- Watership Down<br />
<br />
- Zoey Ashe series<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Zoey Punches the Future in the Dick
