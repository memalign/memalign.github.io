Introducing my latest project: <a href="/m/taptoy/index.html">Tap Toy</a><br />
<br />
Tap Toy is a fun little web app for relaxation. Tap the screen to launch some characters which then bounce off each other. Turn on sound for satisfying sound effects and relaxing public-domain background music. In some ways, I think this toy brings the catharsis of popping bubble wrap to your touch screen.<br />
<br />
I got the idea for this project after watching my then-9-month-old's fascination with my iPhone and iPad. Note that the CDC guidelines recommend "no screen time for children younger than 2 years" (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/downloads/15_256312-A_May_LicensingDocument_Final_508_508tagged.pdf">source</a>, <a href="/m/cdc_screentime.pdf">backup</a>) but these kids will still find a way to grab your device for a fleeting moment before you take it back.<br />
<br />
I wondered if I could make an app to soothe and distract our baby if we ever became truly desperate for a moment of peace. (Fortunately, we still haven't reached this point yet!)<br />
<br />
I modeled some of the behavior after <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Einstein-Along-Tunes-Musical/dp/B000YDDF6O">Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes</a>, one of the more pleasant sound-making toys we have:<br />
<br />

<br />
The result, as my wife described it, is "crack". She was having a bad day when Tap Toy was first ready to play with and she ended up zoning out, addicted, tapping it for 30 minutes while some of her stress melted away.<br />
<br />
As is usual for me, this side-project is a remix of a few other projects:<br />
<br />
- <a href="http://magickeyboard.io">MagicKeyboard.io</a> (<a href="/m/magickeyboard/index.html">backup</a>, <a href="https://github.com/feross/magickeyboard.io">source</a>) by <a href="http://feross.org">Feross Aboukhadijeh</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Which in turn is inspired by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/3t5ssx/magic_keyboard/">reddit post</a> about this <a href="https://momentfactory.com/lab/keyboard-magic">art project</a> by Moment Factory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In fact, I kept the keyboard triggers to launch sprites from the right location along the bottom of the screen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I fixed the sound effect code and added background music<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I also added real multi-touch support<br />
<br />
- <a href="/p/pceimage.html">PCEImage</a> (note that the Koffing, Pikachu in Tap Toy show up in <a href="/m/pceimage/index.html">PCEImage Editor</a>'s list of examples)<br />
<br />
Some tips:<br />
<br />
- You can add this web page to your home screen on iOS or Android. If you do that, it'll behave more like a normal app. (I did the extra bit of work to make this a "progressive web app")<br />
<br />
- If you give this to a kid, you can use <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202612">Guided Access</a> to prevent them from leaving the app<br />
<br />
An idea to take this farther:<br />
<br />
- Holiday-themed Tap Toys: Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Chanukah, New Year's Eve, etc<br />
