With a toddler at home, we've come to rely on DoorDash as a quick way for the adults to eat tasty food.<br />
<br />
We're lucky to live in an area densely packed with restaurants. Despite the wealth of options, we often struggle to choose when dinnertime arrives.<br />
<br />
My spouse and I will end up naming restaurants, taking turns rejecting options one-by-one. On some days, nothing sounds good. On some days, we're exhausted from a night of interrupted sleep and lack the energy to pick. Often both.<br />
<br />
I got the idea to make picking a restaurant more mechanical on the hard days.<br />
<br />
At first, I considered building a web app with a database and a nice UI for listing restaurants and saving our history. I spend most of my non-work hours taking care of the baby, exercising, or doing chores so even a simple side-project takes months and comes at the cost of precious sleep hours. I needed a lower-effort way to test the idea.<br />
<br />
I realized I could make this tool in a shared spreadsheet. I used Numbers on iPhone/iPad and shared the sheet with my spouse using iCloud. Google Sheets could've worked too. Spreadsheets are a great low-effort way to solve problems without writing code. I bet a lot of software engineers underutilize spreadsheets.<br />
<br />
Here's how it works:<br />
- Add a row for every restaurant<br />
- Have a column for the last time we ate there<br />
- Have a column for each person with an estimate of how often they are willing to eat at each particular restaurant<br />
- Have a column to note any restaurants someone is actively in the mood to eat at<br />
- The sheet calculates a recommendation for each row:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Too soon: neither person is ready to eat there again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Let's eat (green): both people are ready OR someone is in the mood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Maybe eat (yellow): one person is ready<br />
- At dinnertime, peruse the green and yellow rows to pick efficiently<br />
