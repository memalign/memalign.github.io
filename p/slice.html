Introducing my latest project, playable right in your web browser: <a href="/m/slice/index.html">Slice Tap Toy</a><br />
<br />
Slice Tap Toy can also be saved to your home screen as a PWA (Progressive Web App).<br />
<br />
This project is my spin on the touch screen swipe-to-slice concept. Every pizza can be sliced multiple times, down to tiny slivers. Can you unlock the whole menu?<br />
<br />
Swiping across a touch screen to slice objects is a delightful and fun mechanic. You might remember some of the best early games for iPhone: Fruit Ninja and Cut The Rope.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, these formerly wonderful games are no longer delightful, now with constant interruptions and ads. Go try them and see for yourself. These games have been ruined.<br />
<br />
Slice Tap Toy is a simple passion project so it can be light, fun, and pristine.<br />
<br />
Development details:<br />
<br />
I was inspired to make Slice Tap Toy when I came across <a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/samurai-sam">Samurai Sam</a>, an entry to the 2023 JS13KGames competition. This got me thinking about slicing games.<br />
<br />
I decided to do some quick prototyping by hacking on <a href="/m/taptoy/index.html">Tap Toy</a>'s source code. I vetted that I could track slices from touch and mouse input, draw the slices, and detect collisions without much work. Like the original Tap Toy, I use <a href="/m/pceimage/index.html">PCEImage</a> for the art.<br />
<br />
Like <a href="/m/cr/index.html">CaveRibbon</a> (<a href="/p/caveribbon.html">project details</a>), I used LLMs to help. I could do some things faster, I was able to get the website to look how I wanted without becoming an expert on CSS, and (new to this project) I was able to get artistic inspiration for the art. I asked DALL-E to generate pizza pixel art. What I got were grotesque abominations that, to this day, have eroded some of my enjoyment of pizza. I stared at flesh colored cheese and glitchy toppings and turned them into my own cleaner pixel art pizzas. I'll spare you the examples.<br />
