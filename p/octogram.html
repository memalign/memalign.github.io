In an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38732804">HN post</a> about a very cool <a href="/p/puzzlescript.html">PuzzleScript</a> game called <a href="https://jacklance.github.io/PuzzleScript/play.html?p=cfdcc6e23f1fb3e9de2fd42fafaf4d4c">Enigmash</a>, I learned sad news.<br />
<br />
Jack Lance, the author of the game, died earlier this year.<br />
<br />
I went to his website, <a href="https://jacklance.github.io">jacklance.github.io</a>, and saw that it had been updated to refer to him in the past tense.<br />
<br />
Seeing that the site is hosted on GitHub, I looked at the <a href="https://github.com/JackLance/jacklance.github.io/commit/92fc694347c53c7c87d8d5086aefde10a9a422de">recent updates</a>. I discovered two things:<br />
<br />
- He made this update himself, to show up a few days later<br />
<br />
- He published one last game, Octogram, but unfortunately made a typo in the URL to the game<br />
<br />
Here's a working link to Jack Lance's last game: <a href="https://jacklance.github.io/octogram.html">Octogram</a>.<br />
<br />
It's a super tricky puzzle game with fun wordplay. Give the <a href="https://github.com/JackLance/jacklance.github.io/blob/master/octogram.html">source code</a> a peek if you get stuck -- but beware this will spoil all of the answers!<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;- Due to some technical details of PuzzleScript, none of his PuzzleScript games are in this repo. Instead, they are stored as GitHub gists. I've grabbed a separate <a href="https://github.com/memalign/memalign.github.io/tree/master/m/octogram">backup</a> of every gist linked to by his games page for posterity.<br />
- A YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_xdEIPZ2Po">video</a> where Jonathan Blow mentions Jack's death. "...he was 25... he was already one of the best game designers in the world and was on track to be even better"<br />
