There's not enough time in the day for everything I want and need to do. Parenting, work, exercise, hobbies, sleep, etc.<br />
<br />
I've found that even optimizing a few minutes here and there can add up to make life easier and more enjoyable. I still use tools for consuming <a href="/p/tts-download-into-brain.html">text</a> and <a href="/p/speed-up-av.html">audio/video</a> faster.<br />
<br />
Here's one of the biggest new optimizations I was able to make this year.<br />
<br />
I had a bunch of work time and a bunch of hobby time I wanted to spend in front of a keyboard. This is thoughtful writing or programming time that couldn't be stolen a few minutes at a time while waiting in line, walking between meetings, etc.<br />
<br />
I also had a bunch of underutilized time on a stationary exercise bike. I mostly spent that time reading news feeds or watching TV/movies. I enjoyed that a lot, but it wasn't the right balance of time spent doing that when I had other things I wanted to prioritize.<br />
<br />
I searched for a product that would let me use a laptop or iPad + keyboard case while exercising on the stationary bike.<br />
<br />
I came across <a href="https://airdesks.com">airdesks.com</a> and bought their <a href="https://airdesks.com/products/laptop/laptop-desk/">laptop desk</a>. I got the 64" tall, "Average Size Laptop", No AirShelves config. It's been awesome. I use it on the bike every day and occasionally as a standing desk.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm writing this post while exercising on the bike while my son is napping -- something I couldn't have squeezed in without this desk!<br />
