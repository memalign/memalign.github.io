I recently saw <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/restored-vermeer-painting-finally-reveals-hidden-cupid-in-background/">news</a> that a painting from the 1650s had been restored to unhide a painting-within-a-painting in the background.<br />
<br />
Here's what the "after" and "before" look like:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/vermeer-after-and-before.jpg"><br />
It's fascinating that modern technology can both find the hidden painted-over image and confirm that it was painted over by someone other than the artist.<br />
<br />
I showed my wife who asked "Is that a Vermeer?" which then sent me down another <a href="/p/rabbit-hole.html">rabbit hole</a>.<br />
<br />
I asked "Whoah how could you tell?" and she said that all Vermeer paintings look exactly like this due to similar composition and photo-realistic lighting.<br />
<br />
I found that I was already familiar with one of Vermeer's paintings, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring">Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>, possibly due to its use as an example image in computer vision.<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/912px-1665_Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring.jpg"><br />
Then I stumbled upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim%27s_Vermeer">Tim's Vermeer</a>, a documentary made by Penn and Teller about an inventor (and successful company founder) named Tim Jenison who had a side-project (bordering on obsession) to understand how Vermeer captured such realistic lighting in paintings and then do so himself.<br />
<br />
He ultimately figured out a combination of two mirrors that enable you to color match what's painted exactly to the real scene. It turns the process of painting a brilliant masterpiece into something mechanical, essentially a manual photograph machine with a person holding a paintbrush in the middle.<br />
<br />
He starts out copying an old black-and-white photograph this way:<br />
<br />
<img src="/m/tim-photograph.jpg"><br />
The results are phenomenal! Tim says this was the first painting he's ever made and it was a wholly mechanical process of copying the color he saw in the mirror.<br />
<br />
After that successful proof of concept, Tim sets out to completely recreate one of Vermeer's most detailed paintings.<br />
<br />
Check out the full documentary (it's only 80 minutes long and you can <a href="/p/speed-up-av.html">watch it faster than 1x</a>) to see how he first replicates the physical space and then reproduces the painting. The painting itself takes 130 days.<br />
<br />
Here are some snapshots of the mirror setup and the final painting:<br />
<br />

By the end of the documentary, I'm convinced that Vermeer used a setup like Tim's. Here's why:<br />
<br />
- At one point, Tim realizes that the mirrors cause slight visual distortion in the form of curving of straight lines. He looks at the original Vermeer and discovers the same distortion!<br />
- The lighting in Vermeer paintings goes beyond what the human visual system can detect across the size of the rooms in the paintings<br />
- The fine detail in the rug in the painting is not perceivable from the artist's distance without the magnifying help of the mirrors<br />
- And several more visual quirks of Vermeer's paintings shown in the documentary<br />
<br />
But don't take my word for it - check it out yourself!<br />
